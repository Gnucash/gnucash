/** @addtogroup Account
    Splits are grouped into Accounts which are also known
    as "Ledgers" in accounting practice. Each Account consists of a list of
    Splits that debit that Account. To ensure consistency, if a Split points
    to an Account, then the Account must point to the Split, and vice-versa.
    A Split can belong to at most one Account. Besides merely containing a
    list of Splits, the Account structure also gives the Account a name, a
    code number, description and notes fields, a key-value frame, a pointer
    to the commodity that is used for all splits in this account. The
    commodity can be the name of anything traded and tradeable: a stock
    (e.g. "IBM", "McDonald's"), a currency (e.g. "USD", "GBP"), or
    anything added to the commodity table.

    Accounts can be arranged in a hierarchical tree.  By accounting
    convention, the value of an Account is equal to the value of all of its
    Splits plus the value of all of its sub-Accounts.

/** @name Account Commodity setters/getters

 *   Accounts are used to store an amount of 'something', that 'something'
 *   is called the 'commodity'.  An account can only hold one kind of
 *   commodity.  The following are used to get and set the commodity,
 *   and also to set the SCU, the 'Smallest Commodity Unit'.
 *
 * Note that when we say that a 'split' holds an 'amount', that amount
 *   is denominated in the account commodity.  Do not confuse 'amount'
 *   and 'value'.  The 'value' of a split is the value of the amount
 *   expressed in the currency of the transaction.  Thus, for example,
 *   the 'amount' may be 12 apples, where the account commodity is
 *   'apples'.  The value of these 12 apples may be 12 dollars, where
 *   the transaction currency is 'dollars'.
 *
 * The SCU is the 'Smallest Commodity Unit', signifying the smallest
 *   non-zero amount that can be stored in the account.  It is
 *   represented as the integer denominator of a fraction.  Thus,
 *   for example, a SCU of 12 means that 1/12 of something is the
 *   smallest amount that can be stored in the account.  SCU's can
 *   be any value; they do not need to be decimal.  This allows
 *   the use of accounts with unusual, non-decimal commodities and
 *   currencies.
 *
 *   Normally, the SCU is determined by the commodity of the account.
 *   However, this default SCU can be over-ridden and set to an
 *   account-specific value.  This is account-specific value is
 *   called the 'non-standard' value in the documentation below.

/** @name Staged Traversal

 * The following functions provide support for "staged traversals"
 * over all of the transactions in an account or group.  The idea
 * is to be able to perform a sequence of traversals ("stages"),
 * and perform an operation on each transaction exactly once
 * for that stage.
 *
 * Only transactions whose current "stage" is less than the
 * stage of the current traversal will be affected, and they will
 * be "brought up" to the current stage when they are processed.
 *
 * For example, you could perform a stage 1 traversal of all the
 * transactions in an account, and then perform a stage 1 traversal of
 * the transactions in a second account.  Presuming the traversal of
 * the first account didn't abort prematurely, any transactions shared
 * by both accounts would be ignored during the traversal of the
 * second account since they had been processed while traversing the
 * first account.
 *
 * However, if you had traversed the second account using a stage
 * of 2, then all the transactions in the second account would have
 * been processed.
 *
 * Traversal can be aborted by having the callback function return
 * a non-zero value.  The traversal is aborted immediately, and the
 * non-zero value is returned.  Note that an aborted traversal can
