/** @addtogroup RegisterCore Register Core
 *  @brief An infrastructure for building a modular matrix of cells like a
 *  spreadsheet or checkbook register.
 *
 *  @details Each cell may be specialized to perform a particular function,
 *  e.g. to read dates, numerical amounts, or text. The register core has been
 *  designed to be easy to extend, modular, easy to maintain, and memory
 *  efficient. It is intended to be used for building financial apps and
 *  spreadsheets.
 *
 *  The register core is built from several types of components: Cells,
 *  Cellblocks, Cursors, and the Table.
 *
 *  The register core should not have any 'knowledge' of the accounting model
 *  of GnuCash or of the workings of the main application. It should not be
 *  specific to a particular GUI (such as Gnome/GTK). It should be possible
 *  to use the register core in a stand-alone fashion.
 *
 *  For information on the GnuCash-specific register implementation that has
 *  been built atop this core, see @ref SplitRegister.
