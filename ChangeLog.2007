	  Advanced Portfolio, improve dividends and brokerage fee
	  handling: * allow proportional application of dividends/fees in
	  a multi-stock txn, * collect reinvested dividend amounts from
	  the buy split not income split, * track reinvested dividends
	  separately from dividend income, * report income when dividends
	  are *not* reinvested if there is a zero value/amount split tied
	  back to the stock account. Thanks to Richard Laager for ideas

	* [r16773] src/gnome-utils/gnc-account-sel.c: Do not set active
	  element of GncAccountSel to the first sometimes. In
	  gas_populate_list, the currently selected account is searched in
	  the new data, falling back to the first element in the list and
	  selecting it afterwards. So, often "Assets" is activated,
	  whereas the filtering happening later does not deselect it in
	  any way (the user may have typed it in). This patch simply
	  removes the fallback to element 1. To make the gas look better,
	  it may help to set it initially, like to an entry that was used
	  recently.

	* [r15753] src/gnome-utils/glade/preferences.glade,
	  src/gnome/dialog-print-check.c: Add preferences support for
	  printing the date format immediately below the date (GtkPrint
	  only), and for setting the font used by the check printing code
	  (GnomePrint and GtkPrint). The fonts actually used by GnomePrint
	  seem very limited compared to those used by GtkPrint, but the
	  font size specification always seems to be honored.

2007-03-24 18:14  hampton

	* [r15752] src/gnome-utils/dialog-preferences.c: Add preferences
	  support for a GtkFontButton widget.

2007-03-24 15:30  andi5

	* [r15751] src/gnome-utils/gnc-html.c: Use
	  gtk_print_operation_set_{use_full_page,unit} for reports.

2007-03-24 15:28  andi5

	* [r15750] packaging/win32/custom.sh, packaging/win32/install.sh:
	  Install.sh: Some package updates, including GtkHTML 3.14.0.
	  Update glib, cairo, pango, gtk+ and gtkhtml. Drop
	  libgnomeprintui, but keep libgnomeprint because goffice depends
	  on it.

2007-03-23 19:40  andi5

	* [r15749] src/backend/file/sixtp.c: On Windows, convert filename
	  parameter for xml parser to system codepage.

2007-03-23 19:38  andi5

	* [r15748] src/backend/file/gnc-backend-file.c,
	  src/backend/file/io-gncxml-v2.c, src/bin/gnucash-bin.c,
	  src/gnome-utils/gnc-gnome-utils.c: Add support for
	  (de)compressing in a thread instead of fork. Use GThreading
	  system when available, but depend on it on Windows. Gzipped data
	  files are still loaded by libxml2. On write, again create a pipe
	  p and a thread t that gzwrites bytes read from p to a given
	  file. After the other thread has finished writing to p, it waits
	  for t to return to avoid loss of data.

2007-03-22 08:15  andi5

	* [r15747] packaging/win32/install.sh: Install.sh: Do not mix
	  pexports and ".." as noted by Nathan Buchanan. pexports
	  somestimes crashes in a new MSYS shell if a path, like the one
	  to a header file, contains "..".

2007-03-21 22:50  andi5

	* [r15746] src/engine/gnc-filepath-utils.c: Patch from James
	  Radley to allow override of the dotfile location. Read
	  environment variable GNC_DOT_DIR and, if available, use this
	  instead of `g_get_home_dir`/.gnucash. This allows one develop
	  without impacting an existing stable installation, excepting
	  shared GConf keys. Setting HOME does not help, because
	  g_get_home_dir prefers passwd entries.

2007-03-21 20:03  andi5

	* [r15745] configure.in, src/engine/Makefile.am: Remove almost
	  unused configure output variables.
	  GNUCASH_{APP_UTILS,GNOME_UTILS,REGISTER_CORE}_{CFLAGS,LIBS} and
	  GNC_FALSE have been completely unused. GNUCASH_ENGINE_{,BASE}_*
	  could be moved to its only user engine/Makefile.am.

2007-03-21 09:46  andi5

	* [r15744] packaging/win32/install.sh: In install.sh test for
	  htmlhelp, try to build DLL. The HTML Help Workshop includes
	  htmlhelp.lib, but we cannot use it for creating DLLs---it is a
	  static thingy. So test with -shared in install.sh. It would be
	  nice to have a similar test improvement in configure.in.

2007-03-20 23:42  andi5

	* [r15743] src/gnome-utils/Makefile.am: Fix a typo in
	  gnome-utils/Makefile.am, garbling _SOURCES.

	  src/gnome-utils/print-session.h, src/gnome/Makefile.am,
	  src/import-export/qif-import/Makefile.am,
	  src/report/report-gnome/Makefile.am: Do not check for and link
	  against gnomeprint if gtkhtml uses gtkprint. If GtkHTML uses
	  GtkPrint, reports and checks will use it, so GnomePrint is not
	  needed. Also, remove some spurious GNOME_PRINT_{CFLAGS,LIBS}
	  from Makefile.am files.

2007-03-20 05:19  hampton

	* [r15741] src/gnome/dialog-print-check.c: If the specified check

	  manufactured key names, one key per name.

2007-03-18 22:45  andi5

	  src/gnome-utils/print-session.c,

	  Uncouple print settings for reports and checks again. Remove
	  gnc_{save,restore}_print_settings, revert part of r15733.

2007-03-18 17:37  hampton

	* [r15734] checks/deluxe.chk, checks/gnomeprint/deluxe.chk,
	  checks/gnomeprint/quicken.chk,
	  checks/gnomeprint/quicken_wallet.chk, checks/quicken.chk,
	  checks/quicken_wallet.chk, src/gnome/dialog-print-check.c: Add
	  GUID numbers to check formats. Detect duplicate check format
	  files (by guid) and show a warning dialog to the user. Remember
	  the users selected check format by GUID and not by index. Add
	  text clipping when using GnomePrint.

2007-03-17 17:29  andi5

	  src/gnome-utils/gnc-html.c, src/gnome-utils/print-session.c,
	  src/gnome-utils/print-session.h, src/gnome/dialog-print-check.c:
	  Add support for printing reports with GtkPrint. Also add
	  gnc_{save,restore}_print_settings so that those are shared
	  between report and check prints.
	* [r15732] src/gnome-utils/gnome-utils.i,
	  src/gnome-utils/print-session.c,
	  src/gnome-utils/print-session.h: Remove unused functions in and
	  stop wrapping print-session.[ch].
	* [r15731] configure.in, macros/pkg.m4: If PKG_CHECK_MODULES
	  fails, always print result "no".
	* [r15730] configure.in: Reorder the sequence of some GUI library
	  tests. Allow libgtkhtml-3.14. Merge the two gnc_build_gui=true
	  blocks, only move regex adjustments to the windows specific
	  part. Test for gtkhtml later than before and allow
	  libgtkhtml-3.14 iff gtk+-2.0 >= 2.10 and gog-renderer-cairo.h is
	  available. To actually print with GtkPrint further code is
	  needed.

2007-03-16 09:20  andi5

	* [r15727] configure.in, packaging/win32/install.sh,
	  src/app-utils/gnc-help-utils.c: Harden tests for HtmlHelpW on
	  Windows. Check both, in install.sh and configure.in, whether we
	  can link a test source for HtmlHelpW against the html help
	  import library, instead of just testing for htmlhelp.h or some
	  htmlhelp library thing.

2007-03-15 07:30  andi5

	  CHM file according to the active locale and call gnc_show_help
	  in src/app-utils/gnc-help-utils.[ch]. These new files were
