/* This is a scaled down version of the routine that would be needed
 * to fully convert a gnc-commodity to a scheme data structure.  In an
 * attempt to optimize the speed of price quote retrieval, this
 * routine only converts the fields that price-quotes.scm uses. Since
 * it converts these fields all at once, it should prevent multiple
 * transitions back and forth from Scheme to C to extract
 * the data from a pointers to a gnc-commodity (the older method).
 * This is *not* a reversible conversion as it drops data.
 *
 * When this routine was written, gnucash retrieved all quotes into
 * the user's default currency.  (Did earlier version do any
 * different?)  This routine inserts that default currency into the
 * returned structure as another optimization.
