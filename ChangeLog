2003-09-16  Christian Stimming  <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* src/import-export/hbci/gnc-hbci-kvp.c: Fix broken compile due to
	Linas' change of the kvp_frame_get_frame() arguments. By
	Jan-Pascal van Best <j.p.vanbest@tbm.tudelft.nl>

	* src/import-export/hbci/gnc-hbci-gettrans.[hc]: Code
	refactorization so that the mt940 importer can re-use the existing
	import functions from the hbci module. By Jan-Pascal van Best
	<j.p.vanbest@tbm.tudelft.nl>

	* src/import-export/mt940/gncmod-mt940-import.[hc]: Import module
	for SWIFT MT940 files added. By Jan-Pascal van Best
	<j.p.vanbest@tbm.tudelft.nl>

2003-09-14  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/backend/postgres/test/run-tests.sh: small fix from
	  hawkfan to get tests to work when building outside srcdir.
	* src/backend/postgres/putil.c: fix a bug introduced by Matthew --
	  ANSI C does not allow you to declare a variable in the middle
	  of an expression.  Move the declaration to the top of the function.
	* src/backend/postgres/functions.sql:
	* src/backend/postgres/table-audit.sql:
	  We don't need the trailing semi-colon because the #include adds
	  one.  The double semi-colon causes build failures in some cases.

2003-09-13  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/import-export/ofx/gnc-ofx-import.c:  use <libofx/libofx.h>
	  instead of "libofx/libofx.h" as it's not part of our system.
	  Fixes a dependency problem in 1.8.6 release.

2003-09-11  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/business/business-core/file/gnc-*.c:
	  Add a "slots" parameter to allow for future expansion.  Right
	  now this is completely ignored (which will allow future releases
	  to add a kvp-frame slots to any business function and allow that
	  file to be read by older versions).  Right now the slot is ignored,
	  but that's better than barfing on the data file.

2003-09-09  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/gnome-utils/dialog-transfer.c:  during the dialog startup it
	  tries to build the transfer rate.  This crashes on Solaris because
	  during startup one commodity is still NULL when it tries to print
	  it.
	Fixes bug #121677

	* src/engine/engine-helpers.c:  turn off scheme garbage collection
	  during query->scm and scm->query conversion.  It shaves about 50%
	  off the test-scm-query-string tests.
	* src/engine/test-core/test-engine-stuff.c:  add some code to help
	  track down what the get_random_query() is doing.  Turned off by
	  default.
	* src/app-utils/test/test-scm-query-string.c: make the test
	  deterministic by seeding the RNG with a known value.  There is a
	  known "delay" at #245 with a seed of 1 on Linux systems.

2003-09-04  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	Apply Nigel Titley's patch to fix #103174:
	* src/register/register-core/basiccell.c:
	  - add some debugging messages
	  - don't kill ourself if we're asked to set the value to our own value.

	Description of the problem from Nigel:
	
	The problem is that the SX formula_cell stuff calls (via an
	intermediate step) 

	gnc_basic_cell_set_value_internal (BasicCell *cell, const char *value)

	with value pointing at cell->value. The overall effect of this as far
	as gnc_basic_cell_set_value_internal is concerned is to trash the value
	stored in cell->value *before* re-writing back to the same place (the
	g_free() writes memory management stuff in the first few bytes of the
	value). This is what trashes the debit/credit value in the SX register
	entry.
	
2003-08-29  David Hampton  <hampton@employees.org>

	* src/engine/Account.c: Fix bug in computing cleared balance.  The
	bug was introdiced 4/1.

	* lots of scm files: Remove the RCS "Id:" tag.  Its a PITA when
	syncing between branches.

2003-08-28  Christian Stimming  <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* src/import-export/import-backend.c: Aaarg. Fixed extremely
	stupid bug in the import value setting workaround.

2003-08-19  Chris Lyttle  <chris@wilddev.net>

	* src/scm/main.scm: Update for 1.8.5 release

2003-08-15  Christian Stimming  <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* src/import-export/import-backend.c: Workaround for
	multi-currency importing bug as discussed on gnucash-devel.

2003-08-13  Matt Vanecek   <mevanecek@yahoo.com>

    * src/backend/postgres/PostgresBackend.c pgend_session_begin():
      Moved the pgendUpdgradeDB() call outside of the SQL transaction,
      because the upgrades performed each have their own separate
      transaction.

    * src/backend/postgres/newtables.h: A little bit of cleanup. Also
      changed all the INSERTs to specify column names, to prevent
      problems with column orders between old/new tables.

    * src/backend/postgres/table-audit.sql: Moved bookGuid in
      gncPriceTrail to be the second column.
      
    * src/backend/postgres/table-create.sql: Moved bookGuid in
      gncPrice to be the second column.

    * src/backend/postgres/upgrade.c: (re)Added transaction control
      to each upgrade function.  Also, the following fixes came out
      of regression testing:
    - add_multiple_book_support():  Removed the "NOT NULL" from the 
      ADD COLUMN statements, and placed them in an ALTER TABLE...SET
      NULL construct.  The original is not supported in Postgresql
      and fails to execute.
    - Changed the stpcpy() to use g_strdup_printf() instead, for dynamic
      query assembly.
    - Made a few cosmetic changes to comparisons for readability.
    
2003-08-10  David Hampton  <hampton@employees.org>

	* src/gnome/gnc-splash.[ch]:
	* src/gnome-utils/gnc-splash.[ch]: Move this code to the
	gnome-utils directory.

2003-08-10  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* rpm/Makefile.am: add gnucash.spec to the DIST; clean during
	  distclean.  Rebuild it whenever the .in, Makefile, or config.status
	  changes.  Fixes #119446.

	* src/backend/file/sixtp.c: Add code to read XML files with real
	  namespace declarations.  (see bug #88078)

	* src/*/Makefile.am: Make sure we define PWD, as not all shells
	  define it properly.  Fixes #119114.

	* src/gnome/reconcile-list.c: our parent is a gnc-query-list, not
	  a clist.  Fix a bug so we properly call the parent destroy function.

2003-08-08  Matt Vanecek  <mevanecek@yahoo.com>

    * src/backend/postgres/PostgresBackend.c: Changed all the
      gncEntry references to gncSplit, and entryGuid to splitGuid.
    - pgend_session_begin(): Changed the 2nd qof_backend_set_message()
      message argument to the internationalization format.
    - Changed the pgendUpgradeDB() call to come after a commit--the
      upgrade process uses its own transaction handling (now).
      
    * src/backend/postgres/checkpoint.c:
    * src/backend/postgres/gncquery.c:
    * src/backend/postgres/gncquery.h:
    * src/backend/postgres/txn.c:
    * src/backend/postgres/txnmass.c:
    * src/backend/postgres/events.c: Changed all the gncEntry
      references to gncSplit, and entryGuid to splitGuid.
      
    * src/backend/postgres/functions.sql: Changed the TIMESTAMP args
      to TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE args, and gncEntry args to gncSplit.
    
    * src/backend/postgres/putil.c: Added the execQuery() function
    - sendQuery(): Added internationalization to the
      qof_backend_set_message() call.

    * src/backend/postgres/putil.h: Added the execQuery() prototype.
    
    * src/backend/postgres/table-create.sql:
    * src/backend/postgres/table-audit.sql: Changed all the TIMESTAMP
      types to TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE.  Change all the gncEntry refs
      to gncSplit, and entryGuid to splitGuid.
    - Grouped all the index creates at the end for readability and
      maintenance ease.

    * src/backend/postgres/table-version.sql: Added a new insert row for
      the gncVersion table to reflect these changes.

    * src/backend/postgres/table.m4: Change all the gncEntry refs to
      gncSplit, and entryGuid to splitGuid.

    * src/backend/postgres/upgrade.c: Added message.h and qofbackend.h
      for error messaging support.
    - In each update function, added a call the DB for BEGIN and COMMIT.
    - Changed all the gncEntry and entryGuid to gncSplit and splitGuid.
    - Added the add_timezone_support() function to perform the latest
      upgrades.
    - pgendUpgradeDB(): Add a call to add_timezone_support() if the minor
      version is less than 5.
    - Changed PGEND_CURRENT_MINOR_VERSION from 4 to 5

    * src/backend/postgres/newtables.h: new file for upgrading db tables
      to v1.5.0.

    * src/engine/qofbackend.c -- qof_backend_set_message(): Allow the
      function to accept an NULL argument for the message, and to set
      the backend error message to NULL in such a case.

	FIXES #90768

2003-08-03  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/gnome/druid-loan.c: Apply patch to fix a number of
	  off-by-one bugs in the loan druid.  Fixes #119001.

2003-07-30  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/gnome-utils/gnc-account-tree.c: add "(Report)" strings
	  to the various columns displayed in the report currency.
	  Partial fix for #118695.

	* src/business/business-core/gncInvoice.c: set the date-entered on
	  invoice transactions to "now" instead of the post date.  This
	  lets us know when an invoice was actually posted, or a payment
	  was actually made.

	Support "gain/loss" balancing splits on stocks:
	* src/engine/Transaction.c: fix xaccSplitGetPrice() to return '0'
	  if 'amount' is zero but 'value' is non-zero
	* src/register/ledger-core/split-register-model-save.c: if we've
	  already handled the debcred cell then DON'T handle the price cell
	  as it will override the debcred's value.
	* src/register/ledger-core/split-register.c: if #shares == 0,
	  price == 0, and value (buy/sell) != 0 then allow this entry;
	  it's an income/expense balancing split.
	* src/register/ledger-core/split-register-control.c: if the exchange
	  rate cell is 0 but this is NOT the blank split, then don't run
	  the exchange-rate dialog unless specifically requested.
	* src/register/ledger-core/split-register-model.c: when trying to
	  find the conversion rate for a split, remember if we found
	  a matching split (even if the amount is 0).  If all matching
	  splits are 0, then return 0, not 1.

2003-07-29  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/import-export/qif/ -- add functionality to merge multiple
	  qif file contexts into a single parent context while retaining
	  the ability to add/remove new files.

	* src/import-export/qif-context.c: add functions to get the list
	  of used QifAccount and QifCategory objects from the set of
	  transactions.

2003-07-28  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/business/business-gnome/business-gnome.scm: remove
	  some unused (old) code.

2003-07-28  Christian Stimming  <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* src/import-export/hbci/druid-hbci-initial.c: Add button for
	manual adding of HBCI accounts. Fixes #117760. Requires latest
	OpenHBCI CVS -- next openhbci-0.9.13 will be out this weekend.

	* src/import-export/hbci/gnc-hbci-{getbalance,gettrans,transfer}.c:
	Add saving of the HBCI_API so that bank's status changes will now
	be remembered immediately. However this might save some
	unnecessary information to disk, but hopefully we will have fixed
	that in OpenHBCI soon.

2003-07-28  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/gnome-utils/gnc-date-edit.c: hide the calendar popup
	  on enter/return keypress events (in addition to ESC).
	Fixes #118500

2003-07-27  Matt Vanecek  <mevanecek@yahoo.com>

    * src/backend/postgres/PostgresBackend.c: Added pgendGetBook(),
      to retrieve the QofBook from the session, instead of storing the
      book in the backend object.
    - Where be->book was used, use pgendGetBook() instead.
    - Enhanced debug messages.
    * src/backend/postgres/PostgresBackend.h: Added the qofbook.h
      include, and the pgendGetBook() prototype
    * src/backend/postgres/book.c: Changed pgendGetBook to
      pgendBookRestore() to reflect its functionality of restoring
      the book's data to the engine.
    * src/backend/postgres/price.c: In pgendPriceFind(), couched the
      currenct portion of the SQL statement in an "if" statement,
      because gnc_pricedb_lookup_latest_any_currency() can pass in
      a NULL currency, and stpcpy() doesn't like NULLs.
    * src/backend/postgres/escape.c: enhanced debug messages.
    Fixes bug #116546

2003-07-26  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/engine/qofbackend.h: add a new error, ERR_BACKEND_READONLY
	* src/engine/gw-engine-spec.scm: add new error type
	* src/backend/file/gnc-backend-file.c: differentiate between
	  "file is already locked" and "we can't create the lockfile"
	  so we can let the user know.
	* src/app-file/gnc-file.c: handle the new ERR_BACKEND_READONLY
	  error message by changing the error dialog presented to the
	  user.
	Fixes #117665

	* src/backend/file/gnc-backend-file.c: don't make the chmod() and
	  chown() functions fatal errors.  Warn the user if they fail, but
	  don't fail to save.  In the long run we need some way to pop up
	  warning messages from a backend, but until then we'll have to
	  stick with PWARN() and hope users see the console.
	Fixes #118258

	* src/app-file/gnc-file.c: fix the message to be more appropriate
	  when we hit a READONLY error.
	* src/backend/file/gnc-backend-file.c: return ERR_BACKEND_READONLY
	  on save if the XML write fails and the unlink() fails with
	  ENOENT, EPERM, EROFS, or EACCES.
	* src/engine/qofsession.c: don't call end_session just because
	  there's an error.
	Fixes #117657

2003-07-26  Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>
	
	* src/import-export/import-account-matcher.c: Fix bug #105293

2003-07-23  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/engine/qofbook.c: be sure to delete the book's KVP when we
	  destroy it.

2003-07-22  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/import-export/qif/...
	  more work on the new qif importer.  structure it into a parent
	  context that contains a "list of files" (each file has its own
	  context).  Add some tests to actually test the code.  It
	  actually loads a basic qif file, now.  Still need to perform
	  merging (internal and into GNC) as well as the qif-to-gnc maps.

2003-07-17  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/backend/file/gnc-backend-file.c:  Don't need to set the
	  backend error directly after calling gnc_file_be_get_file_lock(),
	  as get_file_lock will set the backend error itself.

2003-07-16  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/business/business-core/gncInvoice.c: change the description
	  and action of Invoice and Payement Transactions/Splits, to make
	  it easier to print a check off the posted transactions.

	* src/report/standard-reports/cash-flow.scm: fix some labels and
	  add more text to make it more clear what's going on.  Hopefully
	  fixes #104878.

	* src/report/standard-reports/register.scm: add Debit and Credit
	  totals.  Fixes bug #115611.

2003-07-14  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/import-export/qif: an incomplete implementation of a new
	  (written-in-C) QIF importer.  The code compiles but has not
	  been tested.  Yet to do: merging, conversion to gnc, and UI.

	* configure.in: search for db-4.1.  Fixes #116509.

	* src/gnome-util/dialog-transfer.c: fix a bunch more rounding
	  errors, and add more precision to the price.  There is still a
	  problem when acquiring a high-precision price out of the pricedb
	  where it will get truncated in the AmountEdit widget.

2003-07-10  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/import-export/import-parse.[ch]: routines to parse numbers
	  and dates in a mostly-locale-agnostic way.
	* src/import-export/import-format-dialog.c: a dialog to ask the user
	  to choose a format, when parsing just isn't enough.
	* src/import-export/generic-import.glade: add the format_match dialog
	* src/import-export/test/test-import-parse.c: test the import-parse
	  routines.

2003-07-09  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* configure.in: change (and comment out) checks for pthreads
	* macros/acx_pthread.m4: change pthread search (should be removed)
	* src/engine/guid.c: remove pthread code and just use a static buffer.
	  (pthread code is kept within some #ifdef's, just in case we decide to
	   put it back in later).

	* src/app-utils/gnc-ui-util.[ch]: add a function to parse a numeric
	  with the caller providing all the locale-specific information

	* src/business/business-core/gncBillTerm.c:
	* src/business/business-core/gncTaxTable.c:
	  Fix a crash where removing items in the wrong order could
	  cause "Bad Things" to happen -- referencing an invalid
	  object.  When being destroyed, an object should remove itself
	  from it's parent's list of children, in addition to removing
	  itself from it's children's pointer-to-parent.

2003-07-09  Christian Stimming  <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* README: Added remark about gnucash-docs.
	
	* src/import-export/hbci/druid-hbci-initial.c: Clarify the part of
	the HBCI setup about potentially adding HBCI accounts manually.

2003-07-04  David Hampton  <hampton@employees.org>

	* src/gnome/dialog-price-edit-db.c: Add a couple of extra checks
	to prevent crashing if the commodity attached to a price quote has
	disappeared. #111643

	* src/gnome/dialog-commodities.c: Provide a new warning message
	before deletion if a commodity has any quice quotes.  If the user
	deletes the commodity anyway, removed any quotes are based on the
	commodity

	* src/engine/gnc-pricedb.c: Enhance the get prices routine to
	handle a request with a NULL currency.

2003-07-03  David Hampton  <hampton@employees.org>

	* src/scm/price-quotes.scm:
	* src/engine/gnc-commodity.[ch]: Allow the user to specify by
	namespace which commodities should be retrieved when getting price
	quotes.

	* src/scm/command-line.scm:
	* src/scm/main.scm: Support a new command line argument for
	specifying a namespace.  To be used in conjunction with the
	--add-price-quotes argument.

2003-07-02  Chris Lyttle  <chris@wilddev.net>

	* src/scm/help-topics-index.scm: add Jon Lapham's patch

2003-07-03  Matthew Vanecek  <mevanecek@yahoo.com>

    * po/POTFILES.in: ran make-gnucash-potfile, to pick up all the
    changes for the Qof migration.

2003-07-02  Christian Stimming  <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* src/import-export/hbci/gnc-hbci-transfer.c,
	src/import-export/hbci/dialog-hbcitrans.c: Change HBCI online
	transfer action so that first the gnucash Transaction is created
	and only after that the HBCI connection is started. Necessary for
	later implementation of offline queueing and multi-job execution.

2003-07-01  David Hampton  <hampton@employees.org>

	* src/backend/file/gnc-backend-file.c: New data file should have
	same uid/gidas original file. #105662

	* src/app-utils/gnc-ui-util.[ch]:
	* src/app-utils/gw-app-utils-spec.scm:
	* src/engine/gnc-commodity.[ch]:
	* src/engine/gw-engine-spec.scm:
	Move Finance::Quote related information to live with the rest of
	the commodity related code.

	* src/engine/gnc-engine.h:
	* src/engine/gnc-commodity.[ch]: Convert the price quote source
	data into an object of its own.  Eliminate the old "internal" name
	in favor of the F::Q name.  Dynamically find and add new quote
	sources when the user runs gnucash.

	* src/backend/file/gnc-account-xml-v2.c:
	* src/backend/file/gnc-commodity-xml-v2.c:
	* src/engine/Scrub.c: Ensure backwards compatability of the XML file.

	* src/app-utils/gnc-helpers.c: Update for changes in accessing
	quote source information.
	
	* src/gnome-utils/commodity.glade:
	* src/gnome-utils/dialog-commodity.c: Reorganize the dialog for
	selection price quote information.

	* src/scm/price-quotes.scm: Print debugging info when getting
	stock quotes if gnucash is run with the --debug flag.

2003-06-30  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* macros/acx_pthread.m4: macro to find the pthread library for
	  the particular system
	* configure.in: look for pthread library (now that we actually
	  USE pthreads, even if only for Thread Local Storage).

2003-06-27  David Hampton  <hampton@employees.org>

	* src/backend/file/gnc-backend-file.c: Fix 'Save As' so it can
	write to non-existing files.

	* src/gnc-module/gnc-module.c: Fix a small memory leak.

	* src/import-export/import-main-matcher.c:
	* src/import-export/import-match-picker.c: No need to duplicate
	the string returned by xaccPrintDateSecs.

	* src/engine/Account.[ch]: Correctly mark a function as returning
	a const char string.

	* src/engine/guid.c: Use a thread local buffer for guid_to_string.
	Mark this routine as returning a const char string so any attempts
	to free this buffer will be caught at compile time.

	* src/app-utils/guile-util.c:
	* src/backend/file/gnc-schedxaction-xml-v2.c:

	the pointer returned by this function.

2003-06-27  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/engine/gnc-event*.[ch]:
	  Change the event generation and callback routines to
	  pass a QofIdType in addition to the GUID*

	* src/app-utils/gnc-component-manager.c:
	* src/gnome-utils/gnc-account-sel.c:
	  change to match the new event API.  Remove the need for
	  xaccGUIDType(), which means we no longer get the g_warning.
	
	* src/backend/postgres/events.c:
	* src/business/business-core/gncAddress.c:

2003-06-17  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/engine/QueryNew.h: change QUERY_FIRST_TERM to a #define.
	  It does not need to be part of the enum (it's not even used anywhere)
	* src/engine/QueryCore.h: gint32 prints as a "%d", not a "%ld".

	* src/business/business-core/gncBillTerm.c: fix gncBillTermCopy()
	  so it PROPERLY copies the bill term.  Oops!
	* src/business/business-core/file/gnc-tax-table-xml-v2.c:

	and functions for voiding, un-voiding, and reversing transactions.

	* src/register/ledger-core/split-register-layout.c:
	* src/register/ledger-core/split-register-model.c: Utilized an
	empty register cell for displaying the note entered when a
	transaction is voided.  Added an extra test to

	has been marked read-only.

	* src/engine/Transaction.h: Documentation.
	
	* src/engine/Transaction.c: Create a couple of new functions by
	extracting common code from existing functions.  New functions to

	* src/import-export/qif-import/druid-qif-import.c:  raise the

	* src/gnome/dialog-scheduledxaction.c:
	* src/gnome/gnc-split-reg.c:
	* src/import-export/hbci/hbci-interaction.c:
	  Change dialog statements to allow for embedded percent signs in
	  the messages.  In other words, don't allow user input into the
	  format string of a printf.  There may be other forms of this bug
	  elsewhere -- the code should be manually scrubbed file by file
	  for all printf()'s to make sure no user-servicable strings are
	  used as a printf format argument.  Fixes #115245.

	* src/business/business-gnome/dialog-invoice.c: change how the
	  billterms option menu is used so it will change properly if
	  you change the invoice's owner.  Fixes #115290.

	* src/report/standard-reports/account-piecharts.scm: Don't use
	  gnc:reverse-account-balance? to determine whether to reverse
	  the balance -- base it purely on the report type.  Otherwise
	  certain reports doesn't work right when the "reverse account
	  balances" is set in certain ways.  Fixes #107472.

	* src/engine/Account.c: initialize the returned values in
	  finder_help_function().  This fixes bug #108883 (and possibly
	  others not reported).

2003-06-14  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/backend/file/io-gncxml-v2.c: make the book-string an extern

2003-06-13  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/backend/file/io-gncxml-v2.[ch]: add API to the plugin
	  modules to allow post-processing (scrubbing) of the book after

	  add a NULL scrub member to the XML plugin API.
	* src/business/business-core/file/gnc-tax-table-xml-v2.c:
	  create a scrub function to clear up bogus tax tables due
	  to bug #114888 (and related bugs) which could cause
	  tax tables to get created ad-nausium if you post and then
	  unpost an invoice.  Scrubs all the entries for bogus
	  tax tables, and then clears out the bogus tax tables.
	* src/business/business-core/file/gnc-bill-term-xml-v2.c:
	  Hook in an empty scrub routine, because I think the same
	  bug exists here, but I'll work on that later.
	* src/business/business-core/gncEntry.c:
	  make sure we properly dereference tax tables when we destroy
	  an entry.
	* src/business/business-core/gncTaxTable.c:
	  - keep a list of children so we can unref ourselves from our
	    children when we get destroyed
	  - deal with parentless children
	Fixes bug #114888 -- don't generate phantom (parent) tax tables
	and clean up any existing bogus tax tables.

	* src/business/business-core/gncBillTerm.c:
	  - keep a list of children so we can unref ourselves from our
	    children when we get destroyed
	  - deal with parentless children
	* src/business/business-core/gncCustomer.c:
	* src/business/business-core/gncInvoice.c:
	* src/business/business-core/gncVendor.c:
	  deal with properly un-ref'ing Bill Terms and Tax Tables
	* src/business/business-core/file/gnc-bill-term-xml-v2.c:
	  create a scrub function to clear up bogus bill terms due to
	  bug #114888 which could cause bill terms to get created
	  due to post/unpost of invoices.  Scrubs all invoices and
	  fixes the reference to bill terms, and updates the refcounts.
	Fixes bug #114888 for bill terms.

	* src/business/business-core/gncTaxTable.c:
	* src/business/business-core/gncBillTerm.c:
	  Mark the data book as dirty if a tax table or bill term is
	  destroyed.  Fixes all of #114889 that I can reproduce.

2003-06-12  Christian Stimming  <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* src/*/*/*.c: changes to fix header file includes to support
	  above changes

2003-06-09  Christian Stimming  <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* configure.in, src/import-export/hbci/dialog-hbcitrans.c: Add

	http://sourceforge.net/projects/ktoblzcheck

2003-06-08  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/report/standard-reports/transaction.scm: make sure we have

	Initial fix for #99574

2003-06-08  Christian Stimming  <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* src/import-export/hbci/gnc-hbci-utils.c: Improve error handling.

2003-06-01  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/gnome-utils/gnc-date-format.*: Create a new "date format"
	  widget to let the user choose a date format (and see the results
	  of what the date would look like).
	* src/gnome-utils/Makedile.am: add gnc-date-format files to the build
	* src/gnome/dialog-print-check.c: use the new date-format widget

2003-05-30  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/business/business-gnome/dialog-customer.c:
	* src/business/business-gnome/dialog-vendor.c:
	  - Fix the window title to use the company name, not the contact name
	  - Change the message when the company name is left blank.
	Fixes #109754

	* src/gnome/dialog-print-check.c: a simple change -- use a globally-
	  defined option-menu helper function instead of defining our own
	  copy for no particular reason.

2003-05-30  Christian Stimming  <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* lib/guppi-legend.patch: Include patch for Guppi that fixes

	* src/engine/gnc-commodity.c: Convert from the old Zloty code to
	the new one.

2003-05-30  Christian Stimming  <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* src/report/standard-reports/category-barchart.scm: Re-enable
	reversed legend in stacked barcharts. Needs Guppi 0.40.4
	a.k.a. Guppi CVS, though, to actually work.

2003-05-29  Christian Stimming  <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* src/import-export/hbci/gnc-hbci-transfer.c: Make sure the amount
	stays a decimal number instead of some fraction.

2003-05-29  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/engine/kvp_frame.h: Docs 
	* src/import-export/log-replay/gnc-log-replay.c: Actually make it work:) Thanks Derek for pointing me to the private headers.  Support the new note field.

2003-05-29  Christian Stimming  <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* configure.in: OpenHBCI version 0.9.11 is required now. Earlier
	versions cause a segfault with any recent OpenSSL.

2003-05-29  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/gnome-utils/gnc-query-list.c: the query headers were restructured
	  by linas so we need to add an extra #include to compile
	* src/import-export/log-replay/gnc-log-replay.c: get it to compile.
	  - Doesn't need libofx.h
	  - use TRUE/FALSE, not true/false.

2003-05-28  Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>
	
	* src/import-export/import-settings.c: Revert previous gettext macro addition.
	* src/engine/TransLog.c,h: Change the log format to use GUID instead of 
	  C pointers and to use ISO8601 instead of proprietary format.
	
	* src/engine/gnc-numeric.h 
	* src/import-export/import-match-map.c: Doxygen update

	* configure.in
	* src/scm/main.scm 
	* src/import-export/Makefile.am 
	* src/import-export/log-replay/*: New log replay module.  This
	  ALMOST works, except I forgot you can't set the GUID of
	  gnucash's objects, and thus completely screwed up on the
	  playback logic.  I'll think of a solution when I am rested.

2003-05-28  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/business/business-core/gncTaxTable.c: when asking for
	  the child, return ourself if we're already a child instead
	  of making a (useless) grandchild.

	* src/business/business-ledger/gncEntryLedger.c: fix a bug where
	  if you unpost an invoice and don't bring the TaxTables up to
	  date, the total value shown in the register is different
	  dependending on whether the cursor is on the current line or
	  not.

	* src/business/business-core/gncInvoice.[ch]: change the unpost
	  API to select whether to repoint the entries to the current tax
	  table or leave it at the child tax table.
	* src/business/business-gnome/glade/invoice.glade:
	* src/business/business-gnome/dialog-invoice.c:
	  New UI when unposting an invoice -- ask whether to bring the tax
	  tables up to date or leave the values when it was posted.
	Fixes #113774

	* src/business/business-gnome/dialog-invoice.c: don't constantly
	  resize the invoice window every time we update ourselves.  Fixes

	transfer templates in the book's kvp_frame.

	* src/import-export/hbci/gnc-hbci-trans-templ.[hc]: Add data type
	for online transfer templates.

2003-05-26  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/register/ledger-core/dialog-dup-trans.c: If the "number" is
	  set to 0, then empty out the entry.  Considering the SpinButton
	  wants to force a digit, this lets you set an empty number if you
	  accidentally tab into and out of the number field.  This also
	  means you cannot have a check numbered '0', but that is probably
	  a reasonable limitation.  Fixes #109610.

2003-05-26  Chris Lyttle  <chris@wilddev.net>

	* src/scm/main.scm: Change stable version to 1.8.4 

2003-05-26  Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>

	* src/import-export/generic-import.scm: Add note not to forget to
	  change the c file as well when changing preference page.

2003-05-25  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/report/report-gnome/dialog-view-column.c:
	  - fix a bug in the gh_ -> scm_ conversion:  gh_appendN() needs
	    to be converted to gh_append(gh_listify(..., SCM_UNDEFINED)).
	    Just using gh_listify is wrong and causes a crash.
	  - fix a bug that crashes gnucash if you remove the last entry
	    and then add another entry.
	
	* src/business/business-reports/aging.scm:
	  - Deal with the case where the first transaction found for a
	    particular company is a payment (it used to just ignore it!
	    Oops!  That throws off all the numbers...)
	  - Also print out any overpayment in the total column.

	* src/report/utility-reports/view-column.scm:
	  Catch errors when running the child reports so we display the
	  failed report backtrace but also display an error and continue
	  with the multicolumn report.  Fixes #113668.

2003-05-24  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/gnome-utils/dialog-options.c: back out previous change.
	* src/report/report-gnome/window-report.c: a better fix for
	  #107953.  When we are asked to reload the report, queue the
	  request, queue a draw event, and then return immediately.  When
	  the draw event happens, load the report then.  This lets you
	  hit Apply and then OK before the report finishes loading.

	* src/import-export/ofx/test/Makefile.am: make sure we can find
	  libofx/libofx.h

	* src/report/standard-reports/transaction.scm: include split
	  transactions in the filtering of the transaction report.
	  Fixes #113461.

	* src/report/standard-reports/balance-sheet.scm: use a 'from' date
	  to better compute the Net Income on the report.  Fixes #113196
	  (although not its dependency, #101519; that requires new strings)

	* src/gnome-search/search-double.c:
	* src/gnome-search/search-int64.c:
	* src/gnome-search/search-numeric.c:
	  Change the default Search Operation for numerics from "less
	  than" to "equals" -- so by default you would search for an exact
	  value.  Fixes #106443

	* src/report/standard-reports/price-scatter.scm: "eval" changed
	  API on guile-1.6.  Use the existing API to convert a delta
	  symbol to a delta time.
	* src/scm/main.scm: call eval with the right number of arguments
	  based on early or late versions.

	* src/business/business-reports/invoice.scm:
	* src/business/business-reports/owner-report.scm:
	  Change the date format string to be consistent with other places
	  (e.g. the check print dialog) and use '%' instead of '~'.
	  This is an interim fix for #99574, at least until we can
	  centralize the functionality.

	* src/business/business-utils/business-prefs.scm: make the 
	  Bill Due Days option selectable based on the setting of
	  Notify Bills Due?
	
2003-05-23  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/gnome-utils/dialog-options.c: don't let the user do anything
	  with the options dialog until Apply() finishes.  This is a
	  simple fix for #107953 so that a user can't crash gnucash by
	  hitting Apply and then OK (before the Apply completes).
	  However, what should really happen is that we queue up requests
	  to destroy ourselves and process the event later.  See #107953
	  for more information.

	* src/report/report-system/report-utilities.scm: had the wrong
	  number of arguments in gnc:account-get-balance-at-date.

	* src/report/standard-reports/balance-sheet.scm: add some
	  (commented out) code to support a start date for computing the
	  Net Income (aka Net Profit) in the Balance Sheet.  This is
	  a commented-out partial fix for #113196.

	* src/business/business-gnome/business-gnome.scm:
	* src/scm/main-window.scm:
	  Move the instantiation of File -> Properties into
	  main-window.scm (out of business-gnome.scm) for future cases
	  where we might decide to ship the business modules separately.

	* src/import-export/ofx/test/test-link.c: fix the test program
	  to make sure it links on many weird platforms.
	
2003-05-22  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/business/business-reports/owner-report.scm:  Better fix for 108731
	  limit the itemized invoices/payments to the start/end date range,
	  but print out a "Balance" line if there is a non-zero balance as
	  of the start date.

	Nikos Charonitakis's account chart updates:
	* accounts/el_GR/Makefile.am: added new carloan account chart
	* accounts/el_GR/acctchrt_common.gnucash-xea: updated account chart
	* accounts/el_GR/acctchrt_carloan.gnucash-xea: new car loan chart

	* src/report/standard-reports/average-balance.scm:
	  Use the correct columns when printing the Gain column, don't
	  reuse the same column as profit; we want to report different
	  values.  Fixes #113096.
	
2003-05-21  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/report/standard-reports/advanced-portfolio.scm:
	  Deal properly when there are no prices for a commodity.

	* src/business/business-reports/owner-report.scm:
	  Supply a start date (as well as an end date) and don't print
	  invoices that occur prior to the start date or after the end date.
	  The aging information ignores the start date, but not the end date.
	  This means the aging information will always be acurate through the
	  end date (even if all the invoices and payments are not displayed).
	  Fixes #108731.
	
2003-05-20  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/scm/printing/print-check.scm: some finer adjustments on
	  the locations for Deluxe personal checks.

	* acinclude.m4: modify the AC_GWRAP_CHECK_GUILE() macro to
	  take an argument, the g-wrap module directory.  Then actually
	  test that the g-wrap module loads.  This should detect systems
	  without slib installed.
	* configure.in: all the new gwrap check macro
	  Fixes #113218
	
2003-05-19  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/engine/QueryNew.[ch]: add gncQueryGetBooks() API to return
	  list of books in a query.
	* src/business/business-core/gncInvoice.[ch]: add INVOICE_POST_LOT
	  query parameter methods

	* src/engine/gnc-event*: add an api to force an event even when
	  events are suspended.  Without such an API, events can be lost
	  if the event system is suspended when the event comes in.

	* src/gnome-utils/dialog-query-list*: the glade and C code for
	  a general QueryList Dialog.
	* src/gnome-utils/Makefile.am: compile the new dialog.
	* src/business/business-gnome/business-gnome.scm: use the new
	  querylist dialog to display the due bills
	* src/business/business-gnome/dialog-invoice.[ch]: create a new
	  API to run a due-bills dialog.
	* src/business/businss-gnome/gw-business-gnome-spec.scm: wrap the
	  new due-bills api
	* src/engine/gnc-book.c: forcibly signal a book destroy event

	* src/business/business-gnome/dialog-invoice.[ch]: pass a double
	  instead of an int, because guile-1.6 sucks.  Also fix the Query
	  to actually include the Due Date of the invoice.
	* src/business/business-gnome/gw-business-gnome-spec.scm:
	  change the int to a double on the bills-due api

	* src/gnome-utils/print-session.[ch]: added gnucash wrappers
	  around gnome-print's rotate, translate, gsave, and grestore
	  APIs.  All to allow sideways printing (by rotating the image).
	* src/gnome-utils/gw-gnome-utils-spec.scm: wrap the new print-session
	  apis.

	* src/gnome/glade/print.glade: add "Deluxe Personal Check" type
	* src/gnome/dialog-print-check.c: add support for choosing
	  a "deluxe" check type.
	* src/scm/printing/print-check.scm: add support for printing
	  to "deluxe" personal checks.  This prints the check "sideways"
	  on a US-Letter configuration.

	* src/engine/QueryCore.c:
	* src/engine/guid.c:
	* src/engine/kvp-util.c:
	  Fixes for 64-bit architectures.  Fixes bug #113231.
	
2003-05-18  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/engine/gnc-lot.[ch]: add LOT_IS_CLOSED and LOT_BALANCE
	  query parameter methods

2003-05-17  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/import-export/qif-import/qif-file.scm:  the numeric test
	  regex was broken and would fail on ALL numerics, causing all
	  imports to be of value zero.  Oops.  I _thought_ I tested this,
	  but clearly not sufficiently.  :(

2003-05-16  David Hampton  <hampton@employees.org>

	* src/gnome/window-main.c: 
	* src/gnome-utils/gnc-mdi-utils.c:
	* src/gnome-utils/gnc-mdi-utils.h: Fix the "View xxxbar" menu
	items to track properly when a new data file is opened. #99598
	Consolidate the code for manipulating the View/Statusbar and
	View/Summarybar menu items.  Work around a Gnome MDI bug as best
	as possible.

2003-05-16  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/gnome/reconcile-list.[ch]: Port to the gnc-query-list.
	  Remove all the extraneous code.
	* src/gnome-utils/gnc-query-list.[ch]: Add code so the reconcile-list
	  can successfully use the query-list.  Add a construct() method.
	  Add an "unselect_all()" method.  Add the ability to print numerics
	  as an ABS and invert the sort (defaults to off).  Add methods to
	  determine if an item is in the list, and one to refresh the display
	  of an item.
	* src/gnome-utils/search-param.[ch]: fix the spelling of resizeable

	* src/gnome-utils/gnc-query-list.c: we can't use a reversed list
	  and prepend() because then we're always adding row 0 so the
	  saved checkmarks fail.  So, use the slow way and use 'append()'.
	
2003-05-12  David Hampton  <hampton@employees.org>

	* src/quotes/finance-quote-check.in: 
	* src/quotes/update-finance-quote.in: Add HTML::Parser to the list
	of items checked/installed. #104197

2003-05-12  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/gnome-utils/gnc-query-list.[ch]: an abstracted Query list
	  widget to display the results of a Query.

	* src/engine/Query{,P}.h: move the location of gncQuerySearchFor()
	  to allow callers to look it up without requiring the private
	  header.
	* src/business/business-core/gncInvoice.[ch]: define
	  INVOICE_IS_PAID and create gncInvoiceIsPaid() function (the
	  prototype already existed, but it was never implemented).
	* src/business/business-gnome/dialog-invoice.c: add IS_PAID column
	  and the ability to search for paid/not-paid invoices.
	* src/gnome-utils/Makefile.am: build gnc-query-list
	* src/gnome-utils/gnc-query-list.[ch]: finish the GNCQueryList.
	  - allow active-column sorting
	  - watch all the entities in the query and update when an entry changes
	  - use a checkbox to display booleans
	* src/gnome-utils/search-param.[ch]: add extra APIs required to support
	  the initial QueryList implementation
	* src/gnome-search/dialog-search.c: Convert to use the new
	  GNCQueryList to display the search results.
	Fixes #106035
	
2003-05-11  David Hampton  <hampton@employees.org>

	* src/gnome/dialog-commodities.c: 
	* src/app-utils/prefs.scm: Remember the state of the "show
	currencies" check box from one time to the next.

	* src/gnome-utils/dialog-transfer.c: Fix transfer dialog to not
	hang if OK button is clicked w/o filling in dialog properly.
	#109497

	* src/gnome/window-reconcile.c: Button shouldn't take full width
	of the window.

	* src/app-utils/gnc-component-manager.c: Add some debugging.

	* src/gnome-utils/dialog-commodity.c: Fix problem selecting quote
	source.

	* configure.in:
	* src/gnome/gnc-splash.c:
	* src/gnome/window-main.c: Give more control over what builds have
	a version number and what builds are labelled "cvs".

2003-05-11  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/import-export/hbci/gnc-hbci-utils.c: you have to declare
	  your variables before you g_assert() anything.

	* src/backend/file/gnc-commodity-xml-v2.c:

	* src/gnome-utils/dialog-utils.c:
	* src/gnome-utils/dialog-utils.h: Migrate fields and functions
	related to price quotes from the account to the commodity.  Fixed
	the original complatint in #104197 as part of these changes.

	* src/backend/file/io-gncxml-v2.c:
	* src/engine/Scrub.c:
	* src/engine/Scrub.h: Migrate price quote information when reading
	in the data file.
	
	* src/app-utils/gnc-helpers.c:

	* src/app-utils/gw-app-utils-spec.scm:
	* src/engine/gw-engine-spec.scm:
	* src/scm/price-quotes.scm: The code to get quotes from F::Q now
	needs to get the information from the commodity data structures,
	not the Account data structures.

	* src/backend/file/gnc-account-xml-v2.c: Continue to write out
	price quote information with the Account data. This allows users
	to fall pack to production code without loss of information.  This
	code will drop out in the next release of gnucash (1.10 or 2.0).

	* src/engine/Account.c:
	* src/engine/Account.h: Deprecated a couple of functions.
	Continue existing hack of automatically marking cross currency
	accounts for automatic quote retrieval.
	
	* src/backend/file/io-gncbin-r.c: Update for the new names of
	deprecated functions.
	
	* src/import-export/import-commodity-matcher.c: Update for changed
	calling conventions.

	* configure.in: Restore some lost changes.

2003-05-09  Christian Stimming  <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* macros/openhbci.m4: Fix openhbci macro again so that it uses a C
	check program.

2003-05-08  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* configure.in: add AC_PREREQ(2.53) to require 2.53 :)
	* macros/autogen.sh: add more searches for a good version of
	  the autotools.

	* configure.in: fix some AC_DEFINE macros
	* macros/autogen.sh: a bit more work on the version searches.

	* acconfig.h: remove duplicate entries (for use with more recent autoheader)
	* configure.in: supply AC_PROG_CXX to fix the automake-1.7 problem

2003-05-07  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* macros/autogen.sh: require autoconf >= 2.53 and automake >= 1.5
	  Also look for appropriately-named versions on systems like RH7.3

2003-05-05  Christian Stimming  <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* src/import-export/hbci/dialog-hbcitrans.c, gnc-hbci-utils.h,
	gnc-hbci-utils.c, hbci-interaction.h, hbci-interaction.c: Add
	*much* better error checking -- the user now gets almost always
	correct feedback if an online transfer cannot be executed.

2003-05-05  David Hampton  <hampton@employees.org>

	* macros/openhbci.m4: Fix problem with latest versions of autoconf.

2003-05-03  Christian Stimming  <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* configure.in: Fix hbci and ofx test for handling --disable
	correctly.

2003-05-01  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/import-export/qif-import/qif-parse.scm: Don't assume that a
	  date of the form XXXXXXXX is always YYYYMMDD.  There is at least
	  one example where it is MMDDYYYY.  So, test it both ways:
	  xxxxYYYY and YYYYxxxx.  Make sure a 4-digit year "makes sense"
	  (e.g., the year is after 1930). Fixes bug #111889.

2003-04-29  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/engine/test/Makefile.am: disable the test-scm-query-import
	  test, since it breaks on guile-1.6 (which does mean that
	  importing into a guile-1.6-based system will fail, but so much
	  else fails when upgrading from 1.6 to 1.8 that it really doesn't
	  matter.  Users will have to reset their reports anyways.

2003-04-28  David Hampton  <hampton@employees.org>

	these functions throughout the code.
	
2003-04-26  David Hampton  <hampton@employees.org>

	  #110561.

2003-04-06  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/gnome-util/transfer-dialog.c: Pop up a dialog if the user
	  tries to transfer from a non-currency account, and don't let
	  them do it.  Yes, this means you cannot transfer between mutual
	  funds, but the logic for that can be added later.  This fixes

	* src/gnome-search/search-date.c: Evaluate the date during

2003-04-04  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	  we're in a VIEW/EDIT invoice.

	* src/business/business-ledger/gncEntryLedgerControl.c:
	  Don't ask the user in the general case when making changes
	  to entries.  Generally the user should be allowed to make
	  whatever changes they want without being pestered.

	* src/business/business-ledger/gncEntryLedgerControl.c:
	  Save the entry cells before adding an it to the invoice,
	  otherwise it wont get sorted properly.  Fixes #108910.

	* src/business/business-gnome/glade/date-close.glade:
	  Fix the glade settings so resizing the window will properly
	  resize the widgets.  Fixes #107586.

	* src/business/business-core/business-core.scm:
	  When building the "name + address" string, check if the
	  company name and contact name are the same and, if so,
	  only print one of them.  Fixes #109753.

	* src/business/business-reports/aging-report.scm:
	  Fix a couple strings to improve comments when owners and accounts

	* src/gnome-utils/gnc-account-tree.c:
	* src/scm/main-window.scm: Collapse the account tree data
	declarations into a common table.  Change functions to be driven
	off this data table instead of explicitly coding each field.  Add
	new fields in the account tree window for present, cleared,
	reconciled, and future minimum balances.  #95628
	
	* src/gnome-utils/dialog-account.c: Update for changes to function
	parameters.

2003-03-31  Herbert Thoma  <herbie@hthoma.de>

	* src/engine/gnc-pricedb.c

	gnc_pricedb_lookup_latest_any_currency, return any available
	prices for given commodity regardless of currency
	
	* src/app-utils/gnc-ui-util.c: do a "two stage" price lookup in
	gnc_ui_convert_balance_to_currency if no price for the commodity
	is found in the requested currency, then look for prices in any
	currency and for a exchange rate from the price currency to the
	requested currency

	* src/gnome/gnc-split-reg.c: do currency conversion and show the
	value in the status line of stock and mutual fund accounts

2003-03-20  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* configure.in: don't add -I$(GNC_INCLUDE_DIR) to the engine
	  cflags, because it can cause build warnings on platforms with
	  gcc-3.2, and frankly we don't need it since we don't install
	  before we're building.

2003-03-18  Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>
	* Documentation update

2003-03-16  David Hampton  <hampton@employees.org>

2003-03-15  Christian Stimming  <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* src/engine/gnc-book.h, src/engine/*.h: Added a lot of
	documentation comments, improved doxygen output. At least the most
	important header files will now show up in doxygen.

2003-03-14  David Hampton  <hampton@employees.org>

	* src/gnome/window-reconcile.c (gnc_start_recn_date_changed):
	Don't reverse the account balance here. The routine called to
	retrieve the account balance has already taken care of reversing
	the sign where necessary.

2003-03-13  David Hampton  <hampton@employees.org>

	* src/app-utils/option-util.c (gnc_option_get_range_info): Reapply
	Derek's fix for a crash when opening the Pref's dialog when using

	interface.
	
2003-03-13  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/engine/Makefile.am: make sure to add INTLLIBS in case
	  we're compiling against an external -lintl (like on Solaris)

	* src/calculation/Makefile.am: fix to build on systems that don't
	  have GUILE installed in the system path or in the same place
	  as GLIB.

2003-03-11  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/scm/main-window.scm:  turn off the report-total by default

	  the specific 'printable' name.
	* src/business/business-core/gncInvoice.c: if an invoice is owned

	  to enter any Action they wish.

2003-03-06  Christian Stimming  <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* src/import-export/hbci/dialog-hbcitrans.c: Include a latest
	change in OpenHBCI: Use bank code from HBCI account instead of
	HBCI bank, if the available openhbci version supports it.

2003-03-03  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/business/business-core/business-core.scm: don't export
	  gnc:owner-get-name -- it overrides the g-wrap'ed version

2003-03-02  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/business/business-core/gncEntry.[ch]: add interfaces
	  to deal with bill 'payment types', in preparation for
	  employee expense vouchers.
	* src/business/business-core/file/gnc-entry-xml-v2.c:
	  add support for the bill payment type.

	  add employee support

2003-03-02  Christian Stimming  <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* src/app-utils/prefs.scm: Adjust the names of register styles in
	the preferences to those names used in the register View
	menu. This didn't require changes in any option lookup code.

	* src/gnome/glade/register.glade: 'Duplicate Transaction' could
	either mean 'to duplicate a transaction' or 'the duplicate of a
	transaction'. Both need very different translations. Therefore
	changed 'Duplicate Transaction' in the register into 'Duplicate
	this Transaction' to resolve that ambiguity here.

2003-03-01  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/gnome/dialog-sxsincelast.c: make sure to resume gui refresh events

2003-02-26  Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>

	* src/import-export/import-backend.c: 
	-Disable -3 punishment for transactions which have an online ID.  This punished credit card transfer yet added no tangible benefit.

2003-02-22  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/gnome/glade/account.glade: Increase height of
	  account-hierarchy druid.

2003-02-22  David Hampton  <hampton@employees.org>

	* src/gnome/window-register.c: Don't override the user's toolbar
	style preference by calling gtk_widget_show_all() on the toolbar.
	#102041

	* various: Initial port from the deprecated (in 1.6) guile gh_xxx
	interface to the supported scm_xxx interface.

2003-02-22  Christian Stimming  <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* src/import-export/hbci/dialog-hbcitrans.c: Quick fix to avoid
	online transfers being sent to the bank twice.

2003-02-19  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* configure.in: move AS_SCRUB_INCLUDE _before_ tests so it wont
	  fail on gcc 3.2.2 which actually cares.  This is particularly
	  important for AC_CHECK_HEADER(S)

	* configure.in: change the configure help message from
	  "--enable-gui" to "--disable-gui", because the default is
	  enabled.  Also changed "--enable-error-on-warning" for the
	  same reason.
	
2003-02-18  David Hampton  <hampton@employees.org>

	* acconfig.h: 
	* configure.in: Export the guile version number so it can be used
	in the code.  Add new variable for conditionally including the
	SRFI directory when doing 'make check'.  Should be null when using
	guile 1.6.

	* Various Makefile.am files: Use new conditional include for the
	SRFI directory when running 'make check'.

2003-02-17  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/gnome-utils/dialog-transfer.c: don't round the exchange
	  rate when returning it to callers...  Compute it from the
	  from_amount and to_amount.
	* src/register/ledger-core/split-register.c: change the rate-cell
	  to a shares_print_info so we don't lose accuracy due to rounding
	  errors.
	  Fixes bug #106332

2003-02-16  David Hampton  <hampton@employees.org>

	* src/quotes: List HTML::TableExtract as an explicit requirement,
	since about half of the of Finance::Quote modules require it even
	though F::Q doesn't list it as a dependency.

2003-02-16  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/import-export/import-backend.c: fix a bug keeping the code
	  from compiling.

2003-02-16  Herbert Thoma  <herbie@hthoma.de>

	* src/gnome/gnc-split-reg.c:
	  only display an euro amount in the status bar of a register window
	  if the account currency is a euro currency but NOT euro itself

	* src/gnome-utils/gnc-account-tree.c:
	  auto resize balance and total columns
	
2003-02-15  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/import-export/qif-import/qif-file.scm:
	  - No need to use the 'negative' field anymore
	  - Save the default split, even if we've got a split transaction.
	    It will be useful later to make sure we have a properly balanced
	    transaction and everything has the "right sign"
	* src/import-export/qif-import/qif-objects.scm:
	  - remove the 'negative' field of a split
	  - add a 'default-split' field of a transaction
	  - change the split-amounts and set-split-amounts! functions
	    the split-amounts will also return the default-split, if it
	    exists.  set-split-amounts! will figure out if we need to
	    reverse the splits by seeing if the amounts add up to 0 and
	    coping appropriately..  This is to fix a bug where SOME programs
	    make splits positive, and some make them negative.  This should
	    deal properly in both cases, so it's a better fix for #105139.

2003-02-14  Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>

	* src/import-export/import-backend.c: 
	-Remove unused code.
	-Fix "destination account written to the matchmap even when
	 autoselected" bug.
	-Disable destination account matching by memo, until bayesian
	 filtering is implemented.  It's currently unlikely to help, and
	 causes false positives since very often the type of the
	 transaction is stored there.

2003-02-14  Christian Stimming  <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* src/import-export/hbci/glade/hbci.glade: Clarify some
	HBCI strings.

2003-02-14  David Hampton  <hampton@employees.org>

	* src/quotes/dump-finance-quote: Do a runtime check for
	Finance::Quote instead of including the perl 'use' declaration.
	The latter causes RPM to add a dependancy on F::Q.

2003-02-13  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/gnome-utils/dialog-options.c:  guile-1.6 doesn't like
	  "()" as an empty list.  Change it to "'()" to make it happy.
	  This is backwards compatible with older guiles.

2003-02-12  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* applied Matthew Vanecek's patch to postgres/kvp-sql.c

2003-02-10  Herbert Thoma  <herbie@hthoma.de>

	* src/app-utils/gnc-ui-util.c:
	* src/app-utils/gnc-ui-util.h:
	* src/gnome-utils/gnc-account-tree.c:
	* src/gnome/window-acct-tree.c:
	* src/scm/main-window.scm:
	  recycle ACCOUNT_BALANCE_EURO and ACCOUNT_TOTAL_EURO account tree 
	  columns to display balance resp. total in default report currency

	* src/import-export/import-backend.c: in
	  gnc_import_TransInfo_refresh_destacc move g_assert before first
	  assignment, otherwise I get a syntax error

2003-02-10  Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>

	* src/import-export/import-main-matcher.c: Patch by cmorgan to
	  restrict iterative destination account matching to transactions
	  AFTER the current one in the clist.

2003-02-10  Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>

	* src/import-export/import-backend.c,h: 
	* src/import-export/import-main-matcher.c: Apply most of cmorgan's
	  patch for iterative destination account matching.  Optionally
	  restricting to the transactions after the one being edited still
	  need's to be implemented.

2003-02-10  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* po/POTFILES.in: fox for the search-param.c move

	* src/import-export/import-main-matcher.c: freeze/thaw the clist
	  around the iterator to ease the visual affects.
	
2003-02-09  Chris Lyttle  <chris@wilddev.net>

	* rpm/gnucash.spec.in: fix info file not found.

2003-02-09  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/register/ledger-core/split-register-control.c
	  If we're expanded, ignore TRANS cursor classes.  This prevents
	  a bug where the exchange-rate dialog is realized when there really
	  is nothing to do (because we're in an expanded transaction).
  	* src/register/ledger-core/split-register-model.c
	  Don't PERR() if we have no account -- this prevents annoying
	  messages when handling multi-currency txns in the GL.  Note:
	  all GL txns are displayed in the locale currency (if possible).	
	* src/register/ledger-core/split-register.c
	  AUTO_LEDGER and JOURNAL register types _ARE_ expanded -- return
	  TRUE, not FALSE.
	Fixes 105319

	* src/report/standard-report/advanced-portfolio.scm: add extra
	  arguments to prevent scheme crash.
	Fixes 105405

	* src/gnome/glade/sched-xact.glade: Need to start the Editor dialog
	  as non-visible so the ledger get's sized properly
	* src/gnome/dialog-scheduledxaction.c: resize the cal after the
	  dialog is shown, so it get's sized properly.
	
	Move some files around in preparation for re-factoring the
	reconcile-list code:
	* src/gnome-search/Makefile.am: removed search-param.[ch]
	* src/gnome-search/search-param.[ch]: moved the search-param to gnome-utils
	* src/gnome-utils/search-parah.[ch]: moved search-param from gnome-search
	* src/gnome-utils/Makefile.am: added search-param.[ch]

2003-02-07  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/scm/main.scm:
	* src/scm/command-line.scm:
	  Add a flag to make it easier to turn on and off the various debug
	  messages (except the tip-list, which needs to be done manually).
	* src/scm/tip-list.scm: change the 'development' message

2003-02-05  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/engine/gnc-lot-p.h: some strange platforms assume "char" is
	  0..255 instead of -128..127.  Force a "signed char" to make sure
	  we get the latter interpretation.

	* src/app-utils/gnc-ui-utils.c: Don't round unless force_fit is true.
	  Fixes Debian Bug #179802.

	* src/bin/overrides/gnucash-build-env.in: add business-utils

	* src/business/business-utils/Makefile.am: make scm-links so you
	  can run gnucash from within the build tree
	
2003-02-04  Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>

	* src/import-export/import-backend.c: Add heuristic for duplicate matching by check number.  
	* doc/README.OFX: Update

2003-02-04  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/import-export/qif-import/qif-file.scm: mark "splits" as negative
	  to make sure the numbers are reflected appropriately.
	* src/import-export/qif-import/qif-objects.scm: add a neg? value to
	  a qif-split; use this when converting the split-amount.
	Fixes bug #105179	

2003-02-03  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/calculation/Makefile.am: need to add GUILE_INCS

	* src/engine/Makefile.am: add ${INTLLIBS} for gettext() et al on
	  platforms that don't have it in libc

	* src/backend/file/io-gncbin-r.c: don't need to define functions
	  that are never used, so move the #ifdef around.  Fixes # 105124

	* rpm/gnucash.in: don't call autoconf

	* src/import-export/qif-import/qif-file.scm: fix a
	  wrong-number-of-arguments fatal crash when trying to reparse
	  dates.

	* src/scm/main.scm: fix "development version" message in head
	
2003-02-02  Chris Lyttle  <chris@wilddev.net>

	* configure.in: change to 1.9.0 version
	* README: update for new unstable

2003-02-02  Chris Lyttle  <chris@wilddev.net>

	* rpm/gnucash.spec.in: add options to build ofx,hbci and postgresql

2003-02-02  Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>

	* doc/README.OFX: I've quickly put together some docs for the ofx module and transaction matching.  Also includes a FAQ. Not perfect, but should closebug 99478.
	* doc/Makefile.am: Add README.OFX
	* src/import-export/ofx/README: Remove obsolete file.  
	
2003-02-02  Derek Atkins <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* configure.in: re-enable -Werror, make sure it only is used with GCC,
	  but also move it to the end of the script so it wont interfere with
	  any other configuration test.

	* src/business/business-report/owner-report.scm: fix the column
	  headings and option names to match.  Fix the date-due column so
	  the heading properly goes away.  Also fix some of the
	  internationalization issues -- strings were translated but the
	  translation was not being used.   Fixes # 105036

	* src/backend/postgres/gncquery.c:  change INITIAL_BUFSZ to 32000

	* src/app-utils/option-util.c: use gh_scm2double() instead of
	  gh_scm2int() because guile-1.6 prefers it.  Fixes a crash when
	  opening the Pref's dialog when using guile-1.6.1

	* src/business/business-ledger/gncEntryLedgerLoad.c -- don't add
	  income accounts to bills, or expense accounts to invoices.  This
	  should help further reduce user confusion with what to do when
	  entering invoices.

	* src/report/standard-reports/cash-flow.scm: don't crash when a
	  user does something silly like having a split with no account.
	  Warn the user when we find this situation.

	* src/quotes/Makefile.am: add dump-finance-quote to the DIST

	* po/POTFILES.in:
	* src/import-export/Makefile.am:
	  Removed gnc-gen-transaction.[ch] "properly" for the dist.
	
2003-02-01  Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>

	* src/import-export/gnc-ofx-import.c: No longer assume that transaction with type OFX_OTHER are investement transactions.  Fixes bug reported by Rik harris.
	* src/import-export/import-main-matcher.c: Fix unrelated display bug with balanced (typically investement) transactions.  
	
2003-02-02  Christian Stimming  <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* configure.in: Disable error-on-warning by default because this
	seriously breaks quite a number of configure tests. May be enabled
	again for the development branch, but definitely not for
	end-users.
	
	* configure.in: Fix libofx test. 

	* src/import-export/hbci/gnc-hbci-utils.c, po/de.po: Recognize
	even more error codes from OpenHBCI. Yes, I know this breaks
	string freeze -- but these strings *really* *only* apply to German
	users, so I just fixed the translation myself.

2003-02-01  Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>

	* src/import-export/import-utilities.c: Build on Nigel's patch.
	This hopefully permanently closes
	http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=101705.
	
	* src/import-export/Makefile.am: No longuer compile Christian's
	old matcher.

2003-02-01  Christian Stimming  <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* src/import-export/import-backend.c: Reduced the
	MATCH_DATE_NOT_THRESHOLD to 21 days. Yeah, this should rather be a
	user preference, but IMHO three weeks should already cover the
	basic problem.

	* src/import-export/import-account-matcher.c, import-backend.c,
	import-main-matcher.c, import-match-picker.c: Comment out
	stderr debugging output.

	* src/import-export/generic-import.scm: Move transaction matcher
	preferences to "Online Banking & Import" preference page.

	* src/import-export/hbci/gnc-hbci-cb.c: Add include config.h.

2003-02-01  Matthew Vanecek  <mevanecek@yahoo.com>

	* src/backend/postgres/PostgresBackend.c (pgendEnable):
	Added ENTER/LEAVE statements

	* src/backend/postgres/escape.c: Adde gnc-engine-util.h,
	  and "module = MOD_BACKEND"
	- (sqlEscape_destroy): Added ENTER/LEAVE statemtents.

	* src/backend/postgres/gncquery.c (sql_Query_destroy): Added
	ENTER/LEAVE statements.

	* src/backend/postgres/putil.h: Cleaned up the formatting on the
	SEND/FINISH/EXEC/GET_RESULT macros.  Changed them to use
	PQresultErrorMessage where possible. Made them all set the Backend
	error message string.  Removed the PQfinish() calls, and setting
	be->connection to NULL.  Reasoning: if a malformed query fails, there is
	no reason to close the connection.  If an update/insert fails,
	again, there is no need to close the connection.  The user should
	be presented an error message and respond appropriately.  If
	a update/insert/delete fails, then generally the transaction is
	rolled back to the last BEGIN, thereby preventing data corruption.

	* src/engine/QueryNew.c (gncQueryPrint): Check that q is not NULL
	prior to processing it.

	* src/engine/gnc-engine-util.c: turn off DEBUG on all the modules
	  (for the release).

	* accounts/C/acctchrt_business.gnucash-xea: fix some of the accounts
	  in the tree to be more accurate to the real world.

	* src/register/ledger-core/split-register-module.c: only set ReadOnly
	  status for Invoices, not Payments.  Fixes #105032
	
2003-02-01  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/gnome/window-register.c: fix the query code to use the correct
	  param list.  Fixes bug #104951

2003-01-31  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/import-export/qif-import/qif-file.scm: change the way that
	  parse-fields reports an error or warning.  In particular, return
	  a list such that the error is tied to the actual type.  This will
	  allow us to differentiate a date-parse ambiguity from any other
	  type of ambiguity.  Also add a new procedure that, when given the
	  (cdr parse-results) and a 'type' will return the actual error for
	  that particular type.
  	* src/import-export/qif-import/qif-import.scm: export the new symbol
	* src/import-export/qif-import/druid-qif-import.c: change the logic
	  to use the new parse results and only try to fill the date dialog if
	  there is actually a date parsing ambiguity.

	  Fixes Morrison J. Chang's QIF import problem.

	* src/business/business-gnome/dialog-invoice.c:
	* src/business/business-gnome/glade/invoice.glade:
	  add handlers to immediately save the active and notes fields
	  as they are edited.  Fixes #104954

	  NOTE: This has a side effect of removing an invoice from any
	  open searches, but NOT replacing it if you click on the "active"
	  button.

	* src/business/business-gnome/business-gnome.scm: fix the "bill
	  reminder" so it doesn't create a query if there are no payables
	  accounts.

	* src/gnome-utils/gnc-menu-extensions.c: dgettext() and gettext()
	  return const char*.
	
2003-01-30  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* po/np.po -- add the proper "Plural" header so it builds again.

	* Nathan Neulinger's patch to gnc-split-reg.[ch] to implement
	  a summary-bar "Projected minimum balance".  Somewhat fixes #102440.

	* src/report/report-system/options-utilities.scm:
	* src/report/standard-reports/account-summary.scm:
	* src/report/standard-reports/balance-sheet.scm:
	* src/report/standard-reports/cash-flow.scm:
	* src/report/standard-reports/pnl.scm:
	  change the api to gnc:options-add-account-selection! to allow
	  the caller to set the default choice on "use-subaccounts", and
	  change the cash-flow report to default to 'no'.  This will make
	  sure that "Assets:A/P" is not included (since it shouldn't be).
	
2003-01-29  Matthew Vanecek <mevanecek@yahoo.com>
	
	* src/backend/postgres/Makefile.am: Changed the .sql.c target to
	not echo the beginning and ending quotes.  This is part of the
	gcc 3.x compatibility changes.

	* src/backend/postgres/PostgresBackend.c: Made some whitespace changes
	  for readability.
	- (pgend_book_load_poll): Commented out a PWARN about the old book
	  list not being empty. See added comments for why.
	- (pgend_book_load_poll): added a gnc_session_set_book() call so that
	  the session would have the correct book loaded (i.e., the book
	  that's stored in the DB).
	
	* src/backend/postgres/*.sql: Enclosed each line in a set of
	quotes "..".  The "multi-line literals" were causing compile errors
	for gcc 3.x.

	* src/backend/postgres/gncquery.c: ran indent on the file.
	- (STRING_TERM): Changed the comparison on STRING_MATCH_NORMAL to
	  STRING_MATCH_CASEINSENSITIVE for purposes of adding a '*' to the
	  comparison operator "~".  The code was writing a "=*" which is
	  invalid, but "~*" is valid for case-insensitive regex searches.
	- (sqlQuery_build): Added a "more_and = 0" to the final if statement
	  of the "for (il = qterms; il; il = il->next)" loop.  This will
	  prevent a stray "AND" being appended to the end of the "WHERE" clause
	  of a dynamic query.

	* src/backend/postgres/kvp-sql (store_cb): In "case KVP_TYPE_TIMESPEC",
	changed the 'cb_data->stype = "timespec"' to 'cb_data->stype = "time"'.
	The destination field in the database is defined as 4 characters, and
	the extra chars in stype were causing an insertion error.

	* src/backend/postgres/putil.h (FINISH_QUERY): Changed the error to use
	PQresultErrorMessage() instead of PQerrorMessage().

	* src/backend/postgres/test/db-control.sh (our_pg_ctl): Changed the
	script to return -1 if pg_ctl was not found in PATH.

	* src/backend/postgres/test/run-tests.sh: If db-control.sh returns
	failure, the attempt to connect to $PGHOST on $PGPORT.

	* src/backend/postgres/test/test-db.c: Included QueryNew.h.  Added the
	  _dbinfo struct to pass host, port, dbname, and mode information
	  around. Everywhere that used db_name/mode is now using DbInfor->*.
	- Ran indent on the file.
	- Added a drop_database function to call dropdb on the database used
	  for the tests.  This eventually needs to be changed so that every
	  "return FALSE" first calls gnc_session_destroy(session), before this
	  new function is called.
	- (db_file_url): Changed the function to handle TCP connections as well
	  as socket connections.
	- (load_db_file): Added a PGBackend object from which to get a PGconn
	  connection to store in DbInfo.
	- (test_raw_query): Added a call to gncQueryPrint() if
	  gnc_should_log(MOD_TEST, GNC_LOG_DETAIL)
	
2003-01-29  Herbert Thoma  <herbie@hthoma.de>

	* src/report/standard-reports/cash-flow.scm: only asset accounts
	  are in the default account selection, tables use normal-row
	  and alternate-row
	
2003-01-28  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* configure.in -- fix the PG test to deal properly with non-standard
	  locations.  In particular, AC_CHECK_HEADERS() uses CPPFLAGS, not
	  CFLAGS.
	* src/backend/postgres/Makefile.am: use PGSQL_CFLAGS and PGSQL_LIBS
	* src/backend/postgres/test/Makefile.am: use PGSQL_CFLAGS

2003-01-28  Christian Stimming  <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* po/it.po: Updated Italian translation by Lorenzo Cappelletti
	<L.Cappelletti@mail.com>

2003-01-27  Christian Stimming  <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* po/nl.po: Updated Dutch translation by Hendrik-Jan Heins
	<hjh@passys.nl>

	* src/import-export/hbci/gnc-hbci-getbalance.c: Introduced yet
	more user messages about what is supported by the bank.

2003-01-27  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* configure.in -- don't assume gtkhtml is avail from gnome-config
	  when testing for zvt.  Use the (already aquired) $GTKHTML_LIBS
	  instead.  Fixes Stan's problem from gc-devel.

2003-01-27  Christian Stimming  <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* src/import-export/hbci/glade/hbci.glade: Some more GUI work for
	HBCI setup, like clarifying some comments.

2003-01-25  Joshua Sled  <jsled@asynchronous.org>

	* src/gnome/dialog-scheduledxaction.c (gnc_sxed_update_cal): Fix
	the Recurrence-Frequency example-calendar date calculation to show
	upcoming instances correctly.

	* src/engine/SchedXaction.c (xaccSchedXactionGetNextInstance):
	Remove the validity check on the temporal-state-data's notion of
	the last-occurance date; as invalidity means something important,
	we must let it through; fixes Bug#103955.

	* src/backend/file/gnc-schedxaction-xml-v2.c
	(gnc_schedXaction_dom_tree_create): Make output of the 
	deferred-instance last-date node optional on it's validity.

	* src/gnome/dialog-sxsincelast.c (cancel_check): Change assertion
	into conditional-activity, allowing rational use-case and fixing
	Bug #103182.

	* src/gnome/dialog-scheduledxaction.c (editor_ok_button_clicked):
	Correctly update available SX lists instead of the one we were
	spawned from, which may have disappeared in the mean time.  Fixes
	Bug#103629 [and allows the future fix of not needing to open the
	SX List Dialog when clicking "Advanced..." in the sx-from-transaction
	SX Editor-open vector].

2003-01-26  Christian Stimming  <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* src/import-export/hbci/hbci.scm, gnc-hbci-utils.c: Add
	preference (on advanced tab) to enable HBCI debug messages.

2003-01-25  Christian Stimming  <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* src/import-export/hbci/gnc-hbci-getbalance.c: Fix HBCI problem
	with negative account balances.

	* src/engine/Scrub.c (xaccTransScrubImbalance): Fix rounding of
	the imbalance amount, #104343.

	* po/en_GB.po: Updated British English translation by Nigel Titley
	<nigel@titley.com>.

2003-01-23  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* configure.in -- Apply Bill Nottingham's patch to use db4/db_185.h
	  (fixes #104178)

2003-01-22  David Hampton  <hampton@employees.org>

	* src/bin/gnucash: Tell guile 1.6 not to bitch about deprecated
	functions.

	* src/quotes/dump-finance-quote: Add new script that dumps all the
	data returned by F::Q for a stock.  It also indicates which data
	field gnucash requires, which are optional, etc.

2003-01-22  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/business/business-reports/business-reports.scm -- need to
	  load business-gnome module, which loads gnome-utils module, for
	  a couple HTML definitions (which should eventually be moved
	  elsewhere) so that the reports themselves don't depend on
	  gnome...  This fixes Wilddev's report problem.

	* src/business/business-ledger/gncEntryLedgerModel.c -- relabel
	  the "Account" column to "Income Account" or "Expense Account"
	  to better encourage the user to "choose wisely".

	* src/business/business-ledger/gncEntryLedgerLoad.c -- limit the
	  accounts in the pull-down list to accounts that are NOT
	  placeholder, A/R, A/P, Cash, Bank, or Equity accounts.  This
	  is also to encourage the user to "choose wisely" :)

	* src/business/business-gnome/glade/*.glade -- fix a tooltip to
	  let the user know that they can (should?) leave the ID blank
	  so the system will choose one for them.
	
2003-01-21  David Hampton  <hampton@employees.org>

	* src/quotes/finance-quote-helper.in: Fix problem getting quotes
	from trustnet.
	
2003-01-21  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* configure.in: be more liberal in the use of AS_SCRUB_INCLUDE

2003-01-20  Chris Lyttle  <chris@wilddev.net>

	* configure.in: release 1.7.8
	* NEWS: release 1.7.8

2003-01-20  John Pierce <john@killterm.org>

	* Makefile.am
	  Added distributed generated files to distcleancheckfiles.
          Added distcheck-hook to deal with automake1.5 stupidity.

	* src/doc/Makefile.am
	  Move doxygen log and cache to distclean-local.

2003-01-20  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/engine/QueryNew.c -- g_list_append() can take a LONG time
	  and on big queries the merge can appear to take a long time.
	  So, let's use g_list_prepend() and g_list_reverse() to speed
	  up the process significantly.

	* src/engine/gnc-numeric. -- fix the gnc_numeric_lcd() algo to
	  actually work with numbers that are not co-divisible but have
	  multiple-powers of co-factors.  For example, the old algorithm
	  thought the LCM of 100,96875 was 3100, when it is really 387500,
	  because it was removing the factor of '5' too many times..

	* src/app-utils/test/test-scm-query-string.c -- fix a memory leak
	  in the test.
	
2003-01-19  John Pierce <john@killterm.org>

	* doc/Makefile.am
	* src/doc/Makefile.am

	  Put generated gw-.*.scm files in dist for parity.
	  Put generated sources into dist.
	  Moved generated source to maintainer-clean.

	* src/bin/overrides/Makefile
	  Made built scripts depend on config.status to ensure
	  they're rebuilt when paths change.

2003-01-19  John Pierce <john@killterm.org>

	* macros/autogen.sh
	  Use variables for programs so they can be overridden easily.

2003-01-19  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/engine/gnc-numeric.c -- be more intelligent when operating
	  on numbers of different denominators.  In particular, convert
	  both numbers to the lcd and then operate on them, instead of
	  assuming that a "cross-multiply" is safe.
	* src/app-utils/test/test-print-parse-amount.c -- add more tests for
	  PrintAmountInternal by checking force_fit and round.  Excercises
	  a bug (fixed in this patch) where cross-multiplies were NOT safe.

	* src/gnome-search/dialog-search.c -- reset the search-type to
	  "New Search" if we end up displaying no results.  Fixes bug #97095.

	* src/app-utils/prefs.scm -- combine all the Advanced prefs into one
	  location.  Then add the "New Search Limit" preference.
	* src/gnome-search/dialog-search.c --Use the "New Search Limit" pref
	  to decide when to start a new search vs. when refine the search.
	  Really fix #97095.

	* configure.in: scrub GNOME_PRINT_CFLAGS

	* src/gnome-utils/gnc-gui-query.c -- fix gnc_info_dialog() to deal
	  properly in the case that it's called before the UI is up.

	* src/app-utils/hooks.scm -- create a new 'post-ui-startup' hook
	* src/app-utils/app-utils.scm -- export the 'post-ui-startup' hook
	* src/scm/main.scm -- run the post-ui-startup hook after the UI
	  is up but before we run the ui-event-loop
	* src/business/business-utils/business-prefs.scm -- create two
	  new global preferences: "Notify Bills Due?" and "Bills Due Days"
	* src/business/business-gnome/business-gnome.scm -- create a dialog
	  are runtime (and via a new menu item) that displays all the bills
	  that are due withing "Bills Due Days" days from now.  It's ugly,
	  but it's functional.  Fixes #102439.

	* configure.in -- scrub the CFLAGS for postgres, as per Roland Roberts'
	  report.
	
2003-01-18  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/business/business-core/gncTaxTable.[ch]: add functions to
	  get the GUID and lookup by direct GUID (suitable for wrapping)
	* src/business/business-core/gw-business-core-spec.scm: wrap
	  the taxtable get-guid and lookup methods
	* src/business/business-gnome/business-utils.[ch]: re-implement
	  the "generic option menu" code to allow get_value(), set_value(),
	  and changed_callback() functions.
	* src/business/business-gnome/business-options.c: create a taxtable
	  option type using the new generic optionmenu code
	* src/business/business-gnome/business-options.scm: define a taxtable
	  option.  Also fix all the other options when using a KVP storage
	  to actually load and save the options properly
	* src/business/business-gnome/business-prefs.scm: create a default
	  customer and default vendor taxtable option for the "File Properties"
	  option menu.

	  Initial fix for #93462.  Next commit will actually use the values.

	move code around a lot.
	* Rename a bunch of files:
	  business-options to business-options-gnome
	  business-utils to business-gnome-utils
	  - this required changes to a bunch of files in business-gnome
	* move business-options.scm and business-prefs.scm to business-utils
	* create a business-utils gnc-module
	  - required changes to configure.in, business/Makefile.am
	  - added a bunch of files (generally moved from business-gnome)
	* moved a bunch of other non-gnome definitions out of the gnome-specific
	  locations (gnome-utils -> app-utils, or business-gnome -> business-utils)

	* gncEntryLedgerLoad.c: commented-out code to load tax-tables from
	  the options; waiting until code is actually written.

	* src/app-utils/option-util.[ch]: add new functions to handle
	  kvp-options from C (similar to the gnome-utils functions to
	  create an option dialog from a kvp-frame for a particular
	  object).
	* src/business/business-utils/business-options.[ch]: add code to
	  lookup business options in an option database, from C.
	* src/business/business-ledger/Makefile.am: include business-utils headers
	* src/business/business-ledger/gncEntryLedgerLoad.c: load the tax-table
	  from the book-kvp options and use that as the default tax table

	FIXES 93462.

	* src/app-utils/prefs.scm: Remove "user name" and "user address"
	  preferences, as they are no longer used by anything.
	* src/report/standard/reports/register.scm: we're not using the
	  'invoice' portion anymore, so we don't need references to user
	  name and user address preferences.  This removes the "User Info"
	  page from the Global Preferences.
	
2003-01-16  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/engine/commodity-table.scm: move gnc:commodity-is-currency? here
	* src/engine/engine.scm: export gnc:commodity-is-currency?
	* src/report/report-system/report-system.scm: remove ref to same.
	* src/report/report-system/report-system.scm: remove function above
	* src/import-export/qifiimport/qif-to-gnc.scm: fix the algorithm
	  to find/create new accounts.  All "parent" accounts are of
	  commodity "default-currency" (but don't really care about that).
	  When creating a leaf account, use the security if it's a
	  stock/mmf account, but the default-currency otherwise.
	  Fixes #103633.

	  NOTE:  Might need similar fixed in qif-io-core?

	* qif-merge-groups.scm: Limit matches against only the accounts in
	  the old group, so we don't match against ourselves.  This should
	  limit the matches to only "reasonable" matches, and should fix #102463
	
2003-01-15  David Hampton  <hampton@employees.org>

	* configure.in: Remove restriction on guile versions > 1.4.
	Provide a version dependant load path variable for the SRFI
	location. (Empty in 1.6 since they're bundled with guile.)

	* src/engine/Makefile.am: Don't hard code the location of the
	SRFIs into the guilel load path.

	* src/import-export/qif-import/qif-file.scm: The rdelim module
	moved locations in guile 1.6

	* Makefile.DEPS:
	* src/bin/strsub.c: New files needed for automake 1.4.  These can
	be removed when automake 1.4 is no longer supported for building
	gnucash.

2003-01-15  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/app-utils/test/test-print-parse-amount.c: set force_fit and
	  round to 0 (like they should be) so we don't hit the rounding
	  code and blow up.   Fixes #103536.

	* src/backend/postgres/test/Makefile.am: include run-tests.sh in
	  the distribution.

	* src/register/register-gnome/gnucash-sheet.c: fix a fencepost
	  error where it assumed there would be at least two "visible
	  rows" per block, so search through the end rather than skipping
	  the last row.  This fixes the page-up/page-down problem with
	  invoices.  Also add more places where the visible range is computed.

	* src/business/business-ledger/gncEntryLedgerLoad.c: add code to
	  "show_range()" which should fix the page-up/page-down problem.

2003-01-13  David Hampton  <hampton@employees.org>

2003-01-13  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/app-utils/option-util.c: gh_str2scm() takes a char*, not a
	  const char* (at least in guile-1.3.4), so force the string to be
	  a char* to make the compiler happy.

	* src/engine/date.c: add spaces to the scanDate delimiters,
	  although it may not help if strptime() is doesn't like the
	  spaces.  Attempt to fix #103147, but it's probably a strptime
	  bug.

	* src/business/business-gnome/dialog-invoice.c -- make the Notes
	  field editable for new invoices.  Fixes #103345

	* src/import-export/import-utilities.c -- applied Nigel Titley's
	  patch for #101705

	  when we're creating a new entry.  Unfortunately the gnucash-sheet
	  still never counts the blank entry, and I don't know why.

	* src/engine/QueryCore.c: fix the algorithm to compute equality

	  Fixed bug #103341
	
2003-01-12  David Hampton  <hampton@employees.org>

2003-01-11  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/business/business-core/gncBusGuile.[ch]: functions to interface

	  wrap gncEntryGetInvTaxTable()
	  wrap gncEntryGetBillTaxTable()
	* src/business/business-reports/invoice.scm: only set the "taxable"

2003-01-11  David Hampton  <hampton@employees.org>

	* src/app-utils/gnc-ui-util.c: The "reverse balance" preference
	was moved a while back. Fix this missed reference.

2002-01-11  Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>

	* src/import-export/import-backend.c: Fixed the date heuristics
	  modifications, which had an unfortunate interaction with old

	* src/business/business-core/file/* -- don't save half-built data.
	  Make sure that we're only saving the items that have been fully
	  created (not half-created).  Fixes the cause of bug #102776.

	* src/business/business-core/business-core.scm: return #f if
	  we cannot obtain an owner from a split (in the case of a regularly-
	  entered split)
	* src/business/business-reports/aging.scm:

	* NEWS: release 1.7.7

2003-01-05  John H. Pierce <john@killterm.org>
    * Makefile.am: Added rule for libtool rebuilding.

    * configure.in: Changed AC_DISABLE_STATIC to AM_DISABLE_STATIC
      Look in the right place for srfi modules.
      Reordered output files so directories get created in the right order.

    * intl-scm/Makefile.am: Only find scm files once.
      Fix for non-srcdir builds.

    * src/gnc-module/test/mod-foo/Makefile.am:
    * src/gnc-module/test/misc-mods/Makefile.am:
      Don't install test modules.
        
    * src/backend/postgres/Makefile.am:
      Fixed auto-generation of sources out of srcdir.
      Moved auto-generation sources all to BUILT_SOURCES to generate
      correct depends.
      Removed incomplete explicit depends.

    * src/backend/rpc/Makefile.am:
    * src/backend/postgres/test/Makefile.am:
      Look in engine srcdir for guile stuff.

      Remove unneeded depends.

    * src/engine/gnc-commodity.c:
    * src/engine/iso-currencies-to-c:
      Look for auto-generated files in srcdir.

2002-1-6  Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>
	* src/import-export/import-backend.c: Give a much higher importance
	the date heuristics.   Exact date now worth +3, date within 
	MATCH_DATE_THRESHOLD worth +2, and dates outside 
	MATCH_DATE_NOT_THRESHOLD (now set to 25) are worth -100. 
	The side effect it that any transaction outside a 25 day 
	range can't be matched at all.
	-Disable skipping transactions which already have an online id
	during matching, untill a fix for the "transfer between two 
	accounts" bug is properly fixed.
	* src/import-export/generic-import.scm:
	* src/import-export/import-settings.c:	
	-Disable EDIT action enabling, (it won't be complete for 1.8.0).
	-Fix typos reported by Bill Wohler.
	-Adjust default ADD and RECONCILE threshold to account for above
	change.
	
2003-01-05  David Hampton  <hampton@employees.org>

	* src/app-utils/gnc-component-manager.c: New functions for
	attaching a session to a component, for finding all components
	with a given session, and for closing all components with a given
	session.

	* src/gnome-utils/dialog-account.c: Attach session values to the
	components for "New Account" and "Edit Account" windows. #103531

	* src/app-file/gnc-file.c (gnc_file_new): Before destroying the
	session, call new routine to close any open components related to
	this session. #102531

2003-01-05  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/scm/main.scm -- mention bugzilla in the unstable message

	* src/backend/file/io-example-account.[ch]: add a flag that signifies

	* src/gnome/druid-hierachy.c: ignore account-trees that are
	  marked for exclusion from "select-all".
	* accounts/C/acctchrt_business.gnucash-xea: mark this account as
	  "excluded from select-all"

	* src/backend/file/io-example-account.[ch]: add a flag that signifies

	* src/gnome/druid-hierarchy.c: when loading the example accounts, go
	  through the list and 'select' those that are marked as "start selected"
	* accounts/C/acctchrt_common.gnucash-xea: mark this account tree as
	  "start selected"

	* src/register/ledger-core/split-register-model-save.c: when
	  editing an exchange rate, always change the _VALUE_ of the
	  split, not the amount.  This has the affect of keeping the
	  visible number the same and changing the "other" account.  This
	  should fix #102161

	* src/backend/file/io-example-account.c: fix a logic bug
	* accounts/C/acctchrt_common.gnucash-xea: don't start selected
	* accounts/C/acctchrt_checkbook.gnucash-xea: provide a simple checkbook

	current_session global unless the actual current session is being
	destroyed. 101707.

	* src/backend/file/io-gncxml-v2.c: Pipe the output through zlib if
	the user requested compression. This request is either setting a
	option in the preferences (for all files), or naming the
	particular data file with a .gz extension. #88509

	* src/backend/file/gnc-backend-file.c:
	* src/gnome/top-level.c:
	* src/app-utils/prefs.scm: Create a 'file compression' option and

2003-01-04  Derek Atkkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* add a set of business accounts to the setup druid
	* fix the full and common accounts to remove the (wrong) "Accounts Payable"
	  liability account.

	* src/engine/Transaction.[ch]: add TRANS_NOTES and supporting routines
	  to enable searching for notes.

	* src/gnome/dialog-find-transactions.c: search on NOTES
	  add code to prevent searching on template-txn accounts so SXes don't
	  show up in find results.

	* src/register/ledger-core/*: gnc_table_layout_get_cell() doesn't
	  look at the current cursor, so the multi-currency code was acting
	  all the time, instead of only in registers that needed to be corrected.
	  Fix the code to only apply the multi-currency changes to the correct
	  register types (e.g., NOT stock registers).  Fixes 102549.

	gnome2 when the icon functionality moves from gnome_xxx to
	gtk_xxx.

	* src/engine/gnc-pricedb.h:
	* src/gnome/dialog-price-edit-db.c: Add support for i18n of price
	source strings. Needs to be done at display time because the
	strings are embedded into the data file. #102156

	* src/import-export/qif-import/druid-qif-import.c:
	* src/import-export/qif-import/qif.glade: Add a smart function for

	loaded it returns to the "loaded files" page instead of the
	initial druid page. #101818

	* src/backend/file/gnc-backend-file.c
	(gnc_file_be_load_from_file): Don't free the lockfile name any

	session each time around the while loop so as not to have a
	dangling pointer. #101004

2003-01-03  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/business/business-gnome/glade/invoice.glade: fix a string
	  to make the meaning more clear (per user request)

2003-01-03  Matthew Vanecek <mevanecek@yahoo.com>
	* src/backend/postgres/Postgresbackend.c: Fixed some compiler
	warning messages about MODE_NONE and a some GUIDs used as
	string pointers in informational messages.

	* src/backend/postgres/test/test-db.c: Commented out the
	"short module" declaration.  It was not used and was causing a
	compiler warning.

	* src/backend/postgres/upgrade.c: Changed the "ALTER TABLE table
	ADD COLUMN..." statements to conform to the current Postgres
	implementation (and SQL 92) standard by putting the DEFAULT 
	modifier in a separate ALTER statement.	 This was reported by
	Christopher B. Browne.

2003-01-02  David Hampton  <hampton@employees.org>

	* src/report/report-system/html-utilities.scm: Fix malformed URLs

	specifying sort critera for piecharts and barcharts.

	* src/report/standard-reports/account-piecharts.scm: Add various
	sorting options.  Work around Guppi problem by replacing the
	character "&" with the word "and".

	* src/report/standard-reports/category-barchart.scm: Add various
	sorting options. The default is now by ammount instead of by
	account-code, which is a much more interesting report.  #102342
	Work around Guppi problem by replacing the character "&" with the
	word "and".  Don't "reverse" the barchart legend.  Double-clicking
	on the legend now opend the right child report.

	* src/report/standard-reports/net-barchart.scm: The report title
	should change when the report name field is changed in the
	options. #102266

	* src/report/standard-reports/pnl.scm: The report title should
	change when the report name field is changed in the

	the label when first opening a help window.

	* src/gnome-utils/gnc-html.c (gnc_html_load_to_stream): Delay
	jumping to a label until after the help window has been created on
	the screen. Without this gtk-html computes the wrong scroll offset
	for the window.

	* src/scm/price-quotes.scm: Remove the "checking sources" message.

2003-01-01  David Hampton  <hampton@employees.org>

	* src/gnome-utils/window-help.c (helpWindow): Correctly open a
	help window when the initial URL contains a label component to it.

	* src/gnome/window-reconcile.c: Make the reconciliation window
	respect the 'include subaccount' flag any time it opens a
	register.  Consolidate logic for opening a new register. Enhance
	the reconciliation start window to update the ending value when
	this flag is changed. #101150

	* src/gnome-utils/gnc-amount-edit.c (gnc_amount_edit_key_press):
	If the amount is monetary, map the keypad decimal key to the
	correct decimal character for the locale. #101957

2003-01-01  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/register/ledger-core/split-register-control.c: invert the
	  exchange rate when we're swapping currencies, since the logic
	  of the transfer dialog was reversed.  Fixes bug #102157

	* src/gnome-utils/dialog-transfer.c: call the to_amount_update_cb
	  handler during certain paths of the ok_cb because the focus-out
	  signal may not get handled in all cases -- so force the issue.
	  Fixes bug #102163

	* src/gnome-utils/dialog-transfer.c: always set the exchange-rate
	  as a positive value (use ABS).  Fixes the rest of #102163.

	* src/register/ledger-core/split-register-layout.c: fix the
	  rate_cell layout for general ledgers.  Fixed the critical
	  failure from bug #101000

	* src/gnome-search/search-double.c:
	* src/gnome-search/search-int64.c:
	  read the value out of the GNCAmountEdit entry when we create
	  the Query Predicate, because we're not getting the amount_changed
	  signal.  Fixes #101000.

	* src/business/business-core/gncInvoice.[ch]: create new function
	  for logic to apply a payment.  Moved logic from dialog-payment.
	* src/business/business-gnome/dialog-payment.c: move logic to
	  apply payment to business-core.

	* src/engine/Account.[ch]: add an xaccAccountRemoveLot() function to allow
	  the LOT code to clear memory when you destroy a lot.  Fixes a crash
	  when you destroy a lot.
	* src/engine/Transaction.[ch]: add an xaccTransClearReadOnly() function
	  to let you clear the flag so you can then remove an transaction.  Only
	  for internal uses only!  This is used by the Invoice UnPost code.
	* src/engine/gnc-lot.c: remove the lot from the account's list of lots
	  when the last split is gone.

	* src/business/business-core/gncInvoice.[ch]: implement Unpost function
	* src/business/business-ledger/gncEntryLedger.[ch]: change the
	  set_readonly() function to let you toggle back and forth between
	  readonly and readwrite ledgers.
	* src/business/business-gnome/dialog-invoice.c: implement unpost; set back
	  to readwrite if the unpost succeeds
	* src/business/business-gnome/dialog-order.c: use new set_readonly() API
	FIXES BUG #101452

	* configure.in: add a blatent warning that the RPC code is broke!
	* src/scm/command-line.scm: change the message to let people know that
	  the rpc-server command-line option only works if gnucash was compiled
	  with rpc enabled.
	
2002-12-30  Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>
	* src/import-export/hbci/druid-hbci-initial.c
	* src/import-export/hbci/gnc-hbci-utils.c:
	Fix a bunch of "warning: deprecated use of label at end of
	compound statement" in gcc3 in select statements (added 
	semicolons after default: so that I don't break anything,
	but it should probably output an error instead).

2002-12-30  Christian Stimming  <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* src/report/standard-reports/cash-flow.scm: Patch by Ed Warnicke
	<hagbard@physics.rutgers.edu>.

	* src/backend/postgres/PostgresBackend.c: Added some ENTER
	and LEAVE statements to more of the functions.

	FormulaCell from MOD_SX to MOD_REGISTER.

	* src/engine/FreqSpec.c (xaccFreqSpecGetFreqStr):
	s/g_string_sprintf/snprintf/, as the former can't handle the
	re-ordered format parameters which the po-files use; fixes
	Bug#101650.

2002-12-28  David Hampton  <hampton@employees.org>

	* src/gnome-utils/dialog-transfer.c: Revert pricedb lookup at
	warlord's request.

	ASCII text.  Reset the base_location properly when switching
	documents. Add debugging. #101783

	* src/report/report-gnome/window-report.c: Update the various
	functions used as stream_handlers to return correct file
	sizes. #101783


	* configure.in: When checking for gtkhtml-1.1, make the lack of

	* src/scm/price-quotes.scm: Add some additional checking.

	
	* src/gnome-utils/dialog-transfer.c: Change logic to multiply by
	the exchange rate instead of divide.  Look for both both forward
	and reverse currency quotes in the pricedb. Attempt to install
	currency quotes into the pricedb in a consistent manner.  Give the
	user better feedback on exactly what the exchange rate
	means. Obsolete the currency "swap" routine. #101450

	* src/gnome-utils/transfer.glade: Give the user better feedback on
	exactly what the exchange rate means.

	* src/register/ledger-core/split-register-control.c: Remove
	function call to obsolete routine.
	
	* src/engine/gnc-pricedb.c:
	* src/engine/gw-engine-spec.scm: Added a new function
	(gnc_pricedb_lookup_day) to retrieve a price quote from a certain
	day, not just an exact time.

	* src/register/ledger-core/split-register-p.h:
	* src/register/ledger-core/split-register.c: Add place to save the
	list of splits used to fill the register.
	
	* src/register/ledger-core/split-register-load.c: 
	If there is a transaction pending when updating the register, use
	the saved list so that the transaction is guaranteed to remain in
	the register until the user finishes editing it. Otherwise,
	populate the saved split list. #92158

	* src/gnome/gnc-split-reg.c: Don't let users delete the split that
	attaches a transaction to the current register.

	* src/gnome/window-reconcile.c: Make sure to set the balance

	routine for user feedback during rendering.

	* src/report/report-system/html-document.scm:
	* src/report/report-system/report-system.scm: Give user feedback

	reports are large tables (which is considered one html item).

	* src/engine/Query.c:
	* src/engine/QueryNew.c:
	* src/business/business-ledger/gncEntryLedger.c: Promote private
	build_param_list() function to a public function named

2002-12-11  David Hampton  <hampton@employees.org>

	* src/gnc-ui.h: New help URLs for Wilddev.

	* src/engine/Account.c:
	* src/gnome/glade/account.glade:
	* src/gnome-utils/dialog-account.c: Support for having an account
	scu that doesn't match the account commodity's scu.  This allows a
	user to notice/correct a case where the two are out of whack and
	correct them (#100295), or to intentionally set them that
	way. (E.G. A currency trading account that trades in $0.0001 USD
	even though the scu for USD is $0.01.)

	* src/backend/file/io-gncxml-v2.c: Call new routines to set the
	account non-standard scu flag, and to get the actual scu on the
	account regardless of the flag.

	* src/backend/file/gnc-account-xml-v2.c: Read/write new indicator
	that the account scu doesn't match the account commodity's scu.

2002-12-11  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/gnome-utils/dialog-transfer.c -- lookup and store entries in
	  the pricedb, and use those entries when you change accounts and
	  dates.  It will only save one entry per "date-time", so you need
	  to use the price editor to remove/change entries in the pricedb.
	  It may be a bit over-zealous of using the pricedb entries -- if
	  you change the date or an account after typing in a number it will
	  over-write your change with the nearest pricedb entry.
	  Fixed Bug #100284.
	
2002-12-11  Christian Stimming  <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* accounts/el_GR/acctchrt_common.gnucash-xea: Greek account

2002-12-09  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/gnome/window-acct-tree.c: Disallow the deletion of accounts
	  with ReadOnly Transactions in them.  You must first "delete" the

	  it requires invoice unposting to work).	 

2002-12-9  Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>
	* src/import-export/import-main-matcher.c:
	* src/import-export/generic-import.glade: Change colors, remove

	 when appropriate.  Change many strings after discussion with 
	Wilddev.

2002-12-8  Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>
	* src/import-export/import-account-matcher.c,h: Add param to 
	 gnc_import_select_account():
	@param ok_pressed A pointer to gboolean.  If non-NULL, whether or
    	not the picker dialog was closed by the user pressing ok will be
    	stored in the parameter.  If no dialog was created by the  
    	gnc_import_select_account() call, TRUE is always returned.
	* src/import-export/ofx/gnc-ofx-import.c: Fix for above change.
	* src/import-export/gnc-gen-transaction.c: Take advantage of
	above change
	* src/import-export/import-main-matcher.c: Take advantage of

	* src/import-export/import-backend.c: Make the auto-balance 
	split have the correct amount in all cases by using 
	xaccTransGetImbalance() instead of the first split's value.
	* src/import-export/import-account-matcher.c:
	-Performance improvements in the display code, and skipping 
	lookup of the kvp frame when not needed.
	-Expand the tree when a subaccount is selected

	* src/register/register-core/formulacell.c: 
	* src/register/register-gnome/formulacell-gnome.c: Filled in a
	long-thought of idea for a formula cell: can contain text unlike a
	pricecell, but doesn't really want to do auto-complete like a
	quickfill cell [what we had been using].  This allows us to
	provide the gnome formula cell which can remap the keypad '.'
	character based on locale; addresses Bug#97065, which is the
	cause of Bugs#97063 and #97062.

	* src/gnome/glade/sched-xact.glade: Remove "[Last Day]" option;
	add "/last day" to 29/30/31 options in gnc-frequency month-based
	selections.

	* src/gnome/dialog-scheduledxaction.c (new_button_clicked): Change
	default new SX frequency to monthly; fixes Bug#100615.

2002-12-08  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* README.cvs: mention gettextize breakage and "cvs up -C"
	  workaround.

2002-12-08  Christian Stimming  <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* src/report/report-system/commodity-utilities.scm: For
	calculation of weighted average, use all accounts and not only
	currency/stock accounts now with the new exchange system.

	* src/import-export/import-backend.c: Fix zero amount in the
	'other' split of an imported transaction by now using
	SplitSetBaseValue.

2002-12-08  David Hampton  <hampton@employees.org>

	* src/gnome/glade/register.glade: Make the register's "Set Date
	Range" window more intuitive by moving a button.

	* src/scm/main.scm: Tweak the file name normalization code.
	
2002-12-7  Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>
	
	* src/import-export/generic-import.glade:  Add user instructions, 
	get rid of apply button.
	* src/import-export/import-main-matcher.c: Speed optimizations, 
	implement import status notification with background color.  
	Clarify strings.

	Note:  The matcher is now feature complete, except for manual 
	transaction editing.  (More optimizations and code review still
	to be done)  I am awaiting comments about the matcher UI and
	and investment transaction importing.
	
2002-12-07  David Hampton  <hampton@employees.org>

	* src/app-utils/gnc-ui-util.c: Consolidate all knowledge about
	Finance::Quote sources into one place. New and renamed functions
	for mapping back and forth from Finance::Quote name to internal
	name to user visible name. Functions to record whether or not F::Q
	is installed properly, and if so, whether a particular source is
	available.

	* src/app-utils/gw-app-utils-spec.scm:
	* src/gnome-utils/dialog-utils.c:
	* src/scm/price-quotes.scm:
	Removed all knowledge about Finance::Quote sources and now use the
	common database.

	* src/quotes/finance-quote-helper.in: Collapse all stock price
	retrieval into a single call using the F::Q->fetch method instead
	of individual per-source calls.

	* src/quotes/finance-quote-check.in: New helper program to read
	and return a list of all available F::Q methods.

	* src/scm/price-quotes.scm: Code to call new finance-quote-check
	program.

	* src/scm/main.scm: Check for available F::Q methods when starting
	up.

	* src/gnome/glade/account.glade:
	* src/gnome-utils/dialog-account.c:
	* src/gnome-utils/dialog-utils.c:
	When not retrieving stock quotes for an account, dim the price
	source labels as well as the option menus.

2002-12-07  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/register/ledger-core/split-register-control.c:
	  - Don't grab the register account for multi-split txns.  Just return NULL.
	  - Better logic in the exchange-rate handler function for when to
	    pop up the dialog, and what to put into it.
	  - add an error dialog for corner cases where we want to force
	    the user to expand the txn in order to get proper conversions.
	
	* src/register/ledger-core/split-register-model-save.c:
	  - export "split_needs_amount()" for use elsewhere
	  - fix the logic in handling debcred changes, in particular for
	    multi-currency cases.  Convert amount->value->amount properly.
	  - handle the case where you change the exchange-rate manually
	    (and do nothing else).
	  - fix the logic in the save-split post-processing for what gets
	    converted when.

	* src/register/ledger-core/split-register-p.h:
	  - export the "split_needs_amount()" api for use in the register.

	FIXES bug #100489

	* src/engine/gnc-commodity.c: change PWARN() to DEBUG() in
	  gnc_commodity_equal(), because the average user doesn't need
	  to know why commodities are not equal.

2002-12-07  Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>	

	More Doxygenification.  Created an Engine module, and a 
	Deprecated list.  Unfortunately, unless we turn on EXTRACT_ALL
	(not very practical currently) not all functions will appear 
	unless they are all documented. 
	* src/engine/Transaction.h: More Doxygenification	
	* src/engine/Account.h: Doxygenify
	* src/doc/doxygen.cfg.in: Minor config change.
	
2002-12-07  Christian Stimming  <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* configure.in: Require openhbci 0.9.4 for HBCI version choosing.

	* src/import-export/import-backend.c: Fix adding the balancing
	split.

	* src/import-export/hbci/gnc-hbci-utils.c: Correctly reparent the
	HBCI widgets when the parent window changes.

	* src/import-export/hbci/hbci-interaction[P].[hc],
	hbci-progressmon.c, hbci.scm: Add option for "close on finish" of
	the HBCI log window.

	* src/import-export/hbci/druid-hbci-initial.c, glade/hbci.glade:
	Add dialog for choosing HBCI version.

	* po/el.po: Updated translation by Nikos Charonitakis
	<charosn@her.forthnet.gr>

	* src/engine/Transaction.h: Extensively added function
	documentation (in order to avoid further amount/value confusion
	down the road), watch doxygen output. Added a lot of 'const' all
	over the place.

	* po/nl.po: Fix use of msgid_plural by adding the appropriate
	header entry.

2002-12-06  Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>
	
	* src/import-export/ofx/gnc-ofx-import.c:  Do the "right" 
	thing for setting split amount and value.
	* src/import-export/import-main-matcher.c: Cosmetic
	improvements for balance display and window resizing.
	* All other affected files:  Doxygenify everything.  Take a 
	look, run make doc, and open src/doc/html/index.html

2002-12-06  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* revert patch in src/engine/Transaction.c -- imbalance is computed
	  by _value_ -- ALWAYS.

	* po/nl.po -- don't use msgid_plural -- it fails to work.
		
2002-12-06  Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>
	
	* src/import-export/import-backend.c:  Fix for gcc2

2002-12-06  Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>

	Huge patch, this is the new generic import 
	architecture/transaction matcher.  Many old
	files were renamed, split or deleted.
	
	* src/engine/Transaction.c,h: 
	- Add a DxaccSplitSetAmount function, 
	- Fix a bug in xaccSplitsComputeValue (Split values were 
	sometimes being summed, which is illogical) that caused 
	xaccTransGetImbalance to sometimes return incorrect values.
	Somebody please review this.  Playing in the engine during
	freeze isn't ideal.
	
	* src/import-export/import-backend.c,h: There is now a 
	real backend, completely independent of the GUI.

	* src/import-export/gnc-gen-transaction.c: This is Christian's
	old matcher, I tried to maintain compatibility, but couldn't 
	really test.  Please note that there is some code 
	simplification that could be done there now that there is a 
	clean backend, and that some values passed between the functions
	might no longer have any effect.
	
	* src/import-export/ofx/gnc-ofx-import.c:  Update for new 
	matcher.  Use the currency reported by libofx and 
	xaccSpiltSetBaseValue when adding a banking/credit card 
	transaction.

	* src/import-export/import-account-matcher.c,h: This is a
	very generic and flexible account matcher/picker.
	
	* src/import-export/import-commodity-matcher.c,h: This is
	a generic commodity matcher/picker.

	* src/import-export/import-main-matcher.c,h: This is the 
	main transaction matcher GUI. It's mostly feature complete
	and should be fairly stable, but probably leaks memory.
	
	* src/import-export/import-match-map.c,h: Derek Atkin's
	generic string/account matching infrastructure.
	
	* src/import-export/import-match-picker.c,h:  This is the 
	interface to pick a matching transaction.  It has been 
	completely ripped from the backend.
	
	* src/import-export/import-settings.c,h:  All user
	settings (or compiled-in settings) are now abstracted in 
	an opaque structure with getter functions.

	* src/import-export/import-utilities.c:	These are utility
	functions to help import module writers. 

2002-12-06  Christian Stimming  <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* po/nl.po, po/uk.po: Updated translations by Hendrik-Jan Heins
	<hjh@passys.nl> and Volodymyr M. Lisivka <lvm@mystery.lviv.net>.

2002-12-06  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/register/ledger-core/split-register-control.c -- Fix the
	  amount display so that the exchange dialog always shows the
	  "amount" in the the local (register) currency.  It will convert
	  the amount to the txn currency if necessary in cases where all
	  accounts involved in a split are different (strange edge case).
	  Fixes #100277

	* src/register/ledger-core/split-register-model-save.c -- Handle
	  the case where only the exchrate changed.  Actually change it!
	
2002-12-06  David Hampton  <hampton@employees.org>

	* src/quotes/finance-quote-helper.in: Add an additional module to
	check for (LWP aka libwww-perl) before attempting to call
	Finance::Quote.  Work around the fact that the Finance::Quote::VWD
	module doesn't return the stock symbol.

2002-12-05  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/gnome-search/Makefile.am: add GDK_PIXBUF_CFLAGS because
	  it is pulled in by gtkhtml, which is pulled in from window-help.	  

	* revert patch -- not needed.  Oops.

	* src/gnome/glade/register.glade -- add "Edit Exchange Rate" menu
	  items to the Actions menu and the context menu
	* src/gnome/gnc-split-reg.c -- turn off Exchange Rate editing on
	  "read-only" registers
	* src/register/ledger-core/split-register-control.c -- fix the logic
	  for when we pop-up the exchange-rate dialog, in particular when the
	  user requests it.   Fixes #100285

	* src/gnome-utils/dialog-transfer.[ch]: add two APIs to set the
	  exchange rate and to set "swapped currencies".  The former will
	  set the "price" and the latter will set a (as of yet unused) flag.
	* src/register/ledger-core/split-register-control.c: Don't pop up
	  the exchange dialog when it is not needed, even when requested.
	
2002-12-04  David Hampton  <hampton@employees.org>

	* src/quotes/finance-quote-helper.in (schemify_quote): Allow stock
	index names to be passed though from gnucash to
	Finance::Quote. Necessary but not sufficient to solve #88118.

	* src/scm/price-quotes.scm ((gnc:fq-get-quotes)): Beef up the
	error handling. Should now print a warning message if the price
	quote lookup fails, instead of crashing. #100186

2002-12-04  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/register/ledger-core/split-register-p.h:
	* src/register/ledger-core/split-register.h:
	  move handle_exchange() API from -p.h to .h to export it
	  for the menus to call.

	* src/gnome/gnc-split-reg.c:  add a handler for
	  exchange-rate menu items..  Partial fix for #100285

	* README: fix references to g-wrap
	* acinclude.m4: fix g-wrap test to fail properly if it cannot
	  find g-wrap-config

	* remove src/experimental/ofx from the build system

	* src/import-export/qif-import/qif-parse.scm:
	* src/import-export/qif-io-core/qif-parse.scm:
	  deal with broken QIF files that give broken bang-fields.  In
	  particular, handle the case where it supplies "!Type Bank"
	  instead of "!Type:Bank"
	
2002-12-03  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/register/ledger-core/split-register-control.c:
	  export the 'handle_exchange()' interface
	* src/register/ledger-core/split-register-p.h:
	  add the 'handle_exchange()' prototype
	* src/register/ledger-core/split-register.c:
	  call handle_exchange() from the save() function to make sure we
	  have an exchange rate if the user hits "Enter" instead of
	  tabbing off the end.  For the record, the logic of the register
	  is HORRIBLE, in that there are multiple code paths to deal with
	  moving the "current location" depending on _how_ you move!  This
	  is awful, and means you need a lot of duplicated code to deal
	  with all the different corner cases.  Someone should re-write
	  this all.

	  Closed bug # 97690
	
2002-12-03  David Hampton  <hampton@employees.org>

	* src/scm/main.scm ((gnc:account-file-to-load)): Normalize the
	path name before using it to open a config files. #90487

	* src/scm/path.scm (gnc:load-user-config-if-needed): Write out a
	new 1.8 version of the config file. Add the 1.8 version to the
	list of files to try an read when reading the config. #100266

	* src/engine/gnc-session.c (gnc_session_load): Don't erase the
	just loaded account information because the backend is reporting
	that the file is from a previous version.  Let the caller decide
	after querying the user. #97270.

	* src/gnome/window-main.c (gnc_main_window_about_cb): Put the
	build date into the about box for development versions of
	gnucash. #99775

	* src/register/ledger-core/split-register-control.c
	(gnc_split_register_move_cursor): Don't delete an empty split if
	its the current transaction split. Dangling pointers are no
	fun. #99774

2002-12-02  Chris Lyttle  <chris@wilddev.net>

	* NEWS: update to new version 1.7.5
	* configure.in: update to new version 1.7.5

	* src/gnome/gnc-split-reg.c (gsr_default_delete_handler): 
	Convert the delete dialogs to follow the existing gnucash standard
	where the cancel button is the rightmost button in the dialog box.
	#98291

	* src/register/register-core/table-allgui.c
	(gnc_table_get_cell_location): Search the entire cellblock for a
	cell. Don't bail if one of the entries isn't populated.  #93831

2002-12-02  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/register/ledger-core/split-register-model-save.c -- fix a bug
	  updating two-split multi-currency transactions from the basic ledger.

	* src/register/ledger-core/split-register-model.c:
	* src/register/ledger-core/split-register-model-save.c:
	  Fix a few rounding errors when computing conversion rates.

	* src/gnome-utils/dialog-transfer.c:
	  don't make some checks if we're acting as an exchange dialog.
	  Set an initial exchange_rate when it's passed in.
	  Grab focus in the price-entry if we're acting as an exchange dialog.

	* src/register/ledger-core/split-register-control.c:
	  reset the rate if the account changed.
	  get the exchange dialog to pop up in expanded txns

	* src/register/ledger-core/split-register-model.c:
	  put the "proper" exchange rate in the RATE_CELL
v	  fix the print_info
	  use ALLOW_SHADOW so the rate-cell gets copied into the cursor

	* src/register/ledger-core/split-register.c:
	  initialize the RATE Cell print-info

	* src/register/ledger-core/split-register-control.c:
	  fill in the "exchange dialog" with entries from the current split/trans
	  change the API to allow a menu-item to pop up the exchange dialog
	
2002-12-02  Chris Lyttle  <chris@wilddev.net>
	
	* src/doc/Makefile.am: fix for failure when building rpm

2002-12-02  Chris Lyttle  <chris@wilddev.net>

	* NEWS: update to new version 1.7.4
	* configure.in: update to new version 1.7.4
	
2002-12-01  David Hampton  <hampton@employees.org>

	* src/engine/Transaction.c (xaccTransOrder): The sort on the
	transaction number filed should be a numeric sort not an alpha
	sort. #99579

2002-12-01  Joshua Sled  <jsled@asynchronous.org>

	* src/gnome-utils/gnc-account-sel.c
	(gnc_account_sel_set_new_account_ability): Change the
	gnc-account-sel's "New..." account button to expand but not fill
	it's allocation.

	* src/gnome/druid-loan.c (ld_pay_prep, ld_pay_save_current): Add
	the ability to independently specify the source/from account of a
	payment; fixes Bug#99467.
	(ld_pay_prep, ld_pay_save_current): Add some insensitive widgets
	to show the escrow account; fixes Bug#99476.

	* src/gnome/druid-loan.c (ld_calc_upd_rem_payments): Get the
	currently-typed value for doing the recalculation, not what the
	gtk_spin_button reports.
	(gnc_ui_sx_loan_druid_create): Recalc the remaining months when
	the period-size OptionMenu changes.
	(ld_pay_prep): Handle better the act of setting up the payment
	page for both the Spec-FromAcct and Through-Escrow options.

2002-12-02  Christian Stimming  <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* src/gnome/window-main.c,
	src/business/business-gnome/business-gnome.scm, src/scm/main.scm:
	Yet more i18n menu insertion fixes.

	* src/gnome-utils/gnc-menu-extensions.[hc]: Added
	gnc_gnome_app_insert_menus to work around i18n problems with stock
	gnome menus. This is now also used from window-acct-tree.c. 

2002-12-01  Derek Atkins <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* move QuickFill and dialog-transfer into gnome-utils

	* business-ledger/gncEntryLedger.c -- delay setting *new = FALSE until
	  just before we call the "new account" dialog.	  

	* src/gnome-utils/dialog-transfer -- update the dialog to enable
	  and "exchange dialog" -- limited use from the register.  This is
	  a first pass at getting multi-currency transactions to work from
	  the register.
	* register/ledger-core/split-register* -- hooks to deal with
	  multi-currency transactions better.  Remember the implicit
	  exchange rates and recompute the split values, so when you enter
	  an amount it gets converted properly and you see what you type
	  (mostly).  Call out to the exchange (transfer) dialog when you
	  create a split to an account different than the transaction
	  currency.  This is a partial fix for 97690.
	
2002-12-01  Joshua Sled  <jsled@asynchronous.org>

	* src/app-utils/gnc-helpers.c (g_date_equals, g_date_hash): Added

	Support for a loan amortization schedule review page; fixes
	Bug#98966.
	(ld_destroy): General post-run allocation cleanup.

2002-11-30  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>
	* src/register/ledger-core/split-register-model.c -- compute
	  implicit exchange rates for balanced, two-split transactions.
	  Fixes bug #99083 (for real)

	* src/register/ledger-core/split-register-model.c -- compute the
	  implicit exchange rates for ALL transactions when necessary.  No
	  longer requires the pricedb for printing split values.  This will
	  display all transactions in the currency of the current account,
	  regardless of the number of splits in the transaction.
	  
2002-11-30  Herbert Thoma  <herbie@hthoma.de>

	* src/report/standard-reports/cash-flow.scm: Added new option
	for output formating, make the output "nicer"
 
2002-11-30  Christian Stimming  <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* src/import-export/hbci/gnc-hbci-getbalance.c: More graceful
	fallback solution when returned balances are zero.

	* src/app-utils/gnc-ui-util.[hc]: Added
	gnc_locale_default_currency_nodefault function since
	locale_default_currency might return a non-locale related
	currency. Fix xaccSPrintAmount. Fixes #95404.

	* src/engine/iso-4217-currencies.scm ("rouble"): Fix mnemonic for
	Russian Rouble which is "RUR" instead of RUB.

	* src/business/business-gnome/business-gnome.scm,
	src/gnome-utils/gnc-mdi-utils.c,
	src/gnome-utils/gnc-menu-extensions.c,
	src/import-export/ofx/ofx-import.scm,
	src/import-export/qif-import/druid-qif-import.c: More i18n menu
	insertion fixes.

2002-11-30  Matthew Vanecek <mevanecek@yahoo.com>

	* Makefile.am: Added the GNC_CTAGS_FILE token, and added the
        ctags target.  Changed the TAGS target to etags, and
	GNC_TAGS_FILE to GNC_ETAGS_FILE.  Removed GNC_TAGS_FILE from the
	noinst_DATA variable.  This makes tag building a manual target.
	Run "make ctags" for Vi tags, or "make etags" for Emacs TAGS.

	* Makefile.TAGS:  Changed the TAGS target to etags, and added
	the ctags target.

	* configure.in:  Added the --enable-ctags option.

	* .cvsignore:  Added tags to .cvsignore.  tags is the file created
	by ctags.

02-11-29  David Hampton  <hampton@employees.org>

	so that it removes the busy cursor even after a report error.

	* src/report/locale-specific/us/taxtxf.scm: 
	* src/report/standard-reports/transaction.scm: Provide progress updates
	while creating reports. #94280

2002-11-29  Christian Stimming  <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* src/import-export/hbci/gnc-hbci-utils.c, gnc-hbci-*.c: Catch the
	condition gracefully when OpenHBCI config file does not exist.

2002-11-29  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>
	* src/gnome-utils/dialog-exchange.h -- header for the exchange-rate dialog

2002-11-28  Christian Stimming  <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* src/import-export/gnc-gen-transaction.c: Use add_threshold
	instead of clear_threshold to determine default txn action.

	* src/import-export/hbci/gnc-hbci-gettrans.c: Give correct
	feedback when no transactions are there.

	* src/import-export/generic-import.glade: Add explaining label for
	importer window.

2002-11-27  Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>
	
	* Makefile.am configure.in src/doc/Makefile.am
	src/doc/doxygen.cfg src/doc/doxygen_main_page.c: Added doxygen
	documentation support, and integrated it into the build system.
	There is a new target, make doc, that can be used to build the
	documentation if you have doxygen installed. Any file in the src
	tree will be included in the documentation if it follows doxygen
	conventions.  The doc created in src/doc/html.  Doxygen is now
	required for make dist.
	
	* src/import-export/:  Enable doxygen documentation.	
	
2002-11-27  Christian Stimming  <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* src/register/ledger-core/gnc-ledger-display.c (refresh_handler): 
	If there is a current split, then ensure that the transaction

	changes. #92158

	* src/register/ledger-core/split-register-control.c
	(gnc_split_register_move_cursor): If all the entries of the

2002-11-23  Christian Stimming  <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* src/import-export/Transaction-matcher.c: Refactor *a lot* of the
	code -- try to separate GUI-dependent tasks from GUI-independent
	ones, and make many functions publicly reachable by declaring
	them in the header file.

	* src/import-export/gnc-generic-import.h, *.h: Move some function
	into new Transaction-Matcher.h (which is included from here for
	now), and add some const's at the kvp functions.

2002-11-21  Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>
	* src/import-export/Transaction-matcher.c: Tweak the matching
	heuristics.
	-Memo and description heuristics now both have a very primitive
	fuzzy match worth +1:  Only the first half of the string is compared.
	The rationale is that this will allow the matcher to skip the
	transaction number sometimes appended after the description by 
	some banks. 
	* src/import-export/ofx/gnc-ofx-import.c:  Transaction memo is
	always written in the split's memo.

	action that will be taken.  RECONCILE is now CLEAR, and IGNORE is 
	now SKIP.
	-Disable numeric scoring.

2002-11-19  Christian Stimming  <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* src/engine/Scrub.c (xaccTransScrubCurrency): Add code to deal

	* src/import-export/Transaction-matcher.c: Change default "RECONCILE"
	action from 'y' (reconciled) to'c' (cleared)

2002-11-18  Derek Atkins <derek@ihtfp.com>
	* configure.in -- fix OFX search to look in /usr/local if it cannot
	  find it in /usr.  It skips the second check if you supply an ofx-prefix.

	* src/gnome/dialog-sxsincelast.c: 
	* src/gnome/dialog-scheduledxaction.c:

	printDate.

2002-11-17  Joshua Sled  <jsled@asynchronous.org>

	work to figure out the correct current-instance-number for
	non-monthly Loan-Repayment SXes.
	(ld_create_sxes): Make the created SXes time out after the length
	of the loan, rather than trying to get the number-of-periods

	assertion-failure if the user select a non-leaf row.

	* various: Clean up compilation warnings.
	
	* src/gnome/window-reconcile.c: Fix a couple of functions that

	functions.

	* src/gnome/window-register.c: Remove some functions that are no
	longer called.

	* macros/as-scrub-include.m4: New macro.

	* configure.in: Use the new AS_SCRUB_INCLUDE macro to remove
	system directories from the compile search path. Prevents GCC 3.x

	(gnc_split_reg_use_extended_popup): Added; replaces
	dialog-schedxaction.c version of same in a cleaner way.
	(gsr_default_schedule_handler): If the transaction which is
	requested to be "Schedule..."d was created from an SX, then the

	* Matthew Vanecek's patch:

	The attached patch contains some immediate bug fixes for the SQL
	back end, and it adds and error message string + accessor/mutator
	to Backend.  Also, in xaccAccountCommitEdit(), added the use of
	PWARN_GUI to display the error message.

	The bug fixes in the SQL backend involved converting the *_QUERY
	macros to functions.

	end up showing the whole account.
	-Fix crash when importing a transaction twice
	-Copy the online id to the reconciled transaction, so the 
	match will be remembered.
	-Do not consider transaction with an online_id kvp frame as

	(gnc_split_register_add_transaction): Don't sort transaction
	splits here. This function gets called every time you switch
	splits, and so can reorder them just when you least expect
	it. #92156

	* src/engine/Transaction.c (xaccTransCommitEdit): Sort transaction
	splits when the user has finished making changes to the
	transaction. #92156

	* src/register/ledger-core/split-register-control.c
	(gnc_split_register_traverse): Move the checking for non-existent
	and placeholder accounts to a separate function, and call that new
	function.

	* src/register/ledger-core/split-register.c
	(gnc_split_register_cancel_cursor_trans_changes): Do a full
	refresh after calling this function.  Cleans up some gui leftovers
	after a delete. (gnc_split_register_get_account_by_name): Add the
	new function that checks for non-existent and placeholder
	accounts.  (gnc_split_register_get_account): Call the new function
	to get the additional checks.  This solves #92157.

	* src/business/business-ledger/gncEntryLedger.c: 
	* src/business/business-ledger/gncEntryLedgerControl.c: Implement
	the equivalent fixes for the business ledger.

2002-11-12  Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>
	* src/import-export/Transaction-matcher.c: Fix previous patch.  
	gcc 3.2 is too forgiving...

	* src/import-export/Transaction-matcher.c: Dynamically generate
	a pixmap to display match confidence graphically.

	* src/import-export/ofx/gnc-ofx-import.c: Fix call to 
	g_strdup_printf in Christian's 2002-11-03 translation patch.

	* src/import-export/Transaction-matcher.c
	* src/import-export/generic-import.glade: First round of

2002-11-12  Joshua Sled  <jsled@asynchronous.org>

	* src/gnome/dialog-sxsincelast.c
	(sxsincelast_tc_row_unsel, sxsincelast_tc_row_sel): Now [again]
	uses the read-only register to show the relevant template
	transaction, so the user has context about any variables they're
	being asked to fill in values for.

2002-11-11  David Hampton  <hampton@employees.org>

	* src/gnome/window-acct-tree.c: Make all the menu callbacks take a
	pointer to the GNC MDI main data structure instead of a pointer to
	a GNC MDI Child data structure. #94972

2002-11-11  Joshua Sled  <jsled@asynchronous.org>

	* src/gnome/window-register.c (regWindowLedger): If we
	gtk_widget_show_all the correct widget [the window], then it's
	available for setting its size and changing the style and whatnot.

	* src/gnome/orig-window-register.c (regWindowLedger): Hack for
	Bug#97640; re-init the style after we've shown the widgets to
	affect a "style change", which lets the GUI nature of the cells
	[combos, autocomplete] init and function.

2002-11-10  Christian Stimming  <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* src/import-export/Transaction-matcher.c: Make newly imported
	transaction "cleared" instead of "reconciled".

	stock quotes for accounts where all the shares have all been
	sold. #95547

	* src/register/ledger-core/split-register.c
	(gnc_split_register_empty_current_trans_except_split): After
	modifying the transaction, leave it in "open" state and mark it as
	the currently pending transaction.  This insures that the register
	does the right thing when leaving this transaction. Also fix
	spelling error in function name. Fix this function to work
	correctly on the blank split. #98134
	(gnc_split_register_empty_current_trans): Fix spelling error in
	function name.

	* src/register/ledger-core/split-register.c: Fix spelling error in

	* gnome/dialog-new-user: don't call the qif-import-druid directly.
	  Add a callback API for the qif-import druid.  Use that callback

2002-11-04  David Hampton  <hampton@employees.org>

	* src/engine/Transaction.c: New functions to get/set read-only
	status on a transaction, and to print a warning message if a
	transaction is read-only.  The engine will not let you delete a
	transaction (or split in a transaction) that is marked read-only.

	* src/business/business-core/gncInvoice.c
	(gncInvoicePostToAccount): Mark as read-only transactions that are
	generated from an invoice.

	(gsr_default_reinit_handler): Honor the read-only setting on a

	  the dialog (use the output from vsprintf, not the input)

	* src/app-utils/Makefile.am: install i18n.h but don't include it
	  in the DIST tarball -- let it be generated from i18n.h.in, which
	  IS distributed.

	* src/business/business-reports/invoice.scm: fix some strings
	  "Invoice Terms" -> "Billing Terms"
	
2002-11-03  Joshua Sled  <jsled@asynchronous.org>

	previously-shared widget definitions into separate places to be
	accessed by window-register.c and gnc-split-reg.c.

	* src/gnome/window-register.c: Massive code-sucking into
	gnc-split-reg.c; this file now only handles the details of being
	the register window: dealing with dates and the extended menus and
	whatnot.

	* src/gnome/gnc-split-reg.c: Added; a better implementation of
	gnc-regWidget.  All the "common" register-editing code has been
	moved here from window-register.c.

	* src/register/ledger-core/gnc-regwidget.c: Removed; replaced with
	src/gnome/gnc-split-reg.c.

	* src/register/register-gnome/gnucash-date-picker.c

	  function.  Fixes 96855.

	  (temporary) top-level account, so the SQL backend doesn't hate us
	  for committing and account without a commodity.

	* business/business-ledger/gncEntryLedgerLoad.c -- set the account
	  completion character for the account cells.  Fixes bug #97098
	
2002-11-03  Christian Stimming  <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* src/gnome/dialog-sxsincelast.c, src/gnome/window-main.c,

	  so users can define where to look for libofx.

	* src/gnome/Makefile.am: 
	* src/gnome/top-level.c (gnc_gui_init): Disable the gnucash
	network code.

	pages. Move some existing prefs to an "Advanced" page.  Disable
	the gnucash network code.

	* src/gnome-utils/dialog-options.c: OK button should always be
	sensitive.  Add support for "Advanced" option pages. These option
	pages begin with the characters "_+".

2002-10-27  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>
	* gncInvoice.[ch]: create gncInvoiceGetTotal(), which currently does
	  nothing but will eventually return the actual invoice total.
	* dialog-invoice.c: add a summary bar with the invoice total
	* invoice.glade: add a summary bar dock at the bottom of the page.
	Partial fix for bug #96833

	i18n.

	section [page] of widgets at at time.

	* src/gnome-utils/dialog-options.c: The cancel button should
	always be sensitive. The OK button should only be sensitive if
	changes have been made to an option. #96465
	(gnc_options_dialog_new): (gnc_options_dialog_append_page): Move
	the reset button to be per-page instead of global. #90370

	* accounts/fr_FR/*: Frederic Lespez's fixes for the
	French account templates.
	
	* src/import-export/qif-import/druid-qif-import.c: Add a working

	the working directory in the file selection dialog and track any
	directory changes by the user. #95668

	* src/gnome-utils/gnc-mdi-utils.c (various routines): When
	switching between MDI styles, the gnome MDI code creates and
	destroys widgets at will.  Because of this, remember the list of
	menu/toolbar *names* to be modified and then look up the widgets
	each time a change needs to be made to the visibility/sensitivity
	of the item. #96302
 	(gnc_mdi_child_changed_cb): If the MDI style is "toplevel", then
	don't update the state of any menu/toolbar items when switching
	out of a window.  Leave them as they were since that window is
	still visible to the user.

	* src/report/report-gnome/window-report.c
	(gnc_report_window_load_cb): Don't try to unprotect the #f
	object. Scheme doesn't normally care, but this will crash if
	running under gdb.

2002-10-26  David Hampton  <hampton@employees.org>

	* src/app-utils/option-util.c (gnc_commit_option): Use the new

	printing a message on stdout. #96166

	* src/gnome-utils/gnc-currency-edit.c (currency_compare): Sort by
	currency identifier since it appears first in the display. #96159
	Change a couple other functions so that the full currency name is
	always displayed in the widget.

	* src/gnome/druid-hierarchy.c: Replace the commodity editor with a
	currency selector. #95594

2002-10-26  Joshua Sled  <jsled@asynchronous.org>

	the auto-create transactions if there are only auto-create,
	no-notify SXes as a result of the since-last-run-dialog
	invocation; fixes bug #96944.
	
	* src/gnome/dialog-sxsincelast.c (sxsincelast_populate): Changed
	return-value from sxsincelast_populate to reflect all the possible
	conditions, allowing...

	Bug#90060.

	* src/gnome/dialog-sxsincelast.c (add_to_create_list_to_gui):
	Setup of to-create page more correct; the first item which needs
	interaction is selected, or the widgets are set to inactive.
	Fixes Bug#96669 and Bug#96665.

2002-10-26  Christian Stimming  <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* src/import-export/hbci/gnc-hbci-kvp.h,
	src/import-export/hbci/gnc-hbci-gettrans.c: Remember the user's
	date of last transaction retrieval. REQUIRES updating to current
	OPENHBCI CVS.

	* src/import-export/hbci/gnc-hbci-utils.c: Cache the created
	HBCI_API for subsequent calls. Will also cache the user's
	password. Also, make more meaningful error handling. 

	* src/import-export/hbci/dialog-daterange.[hc]: Add a dialog
	asking for the date range of transactions to retrieve.

	* src/engine/date.h: Add timespecToTime_t function.

2002-10-25  David Hampton  <hampton@employees.org>

	* src/gnome/window-register.c: Use a better function for making

	(gnc_split_register_set_read_only): New function to set the
	read-only bit on the table underlying the register window.

	* src/gnome/window-main.c: Add a new help menu item for Wilddev and
	rename another one. #96821

	* src/gnome/window-register.c: Split the transaction delete
	functionality into two functions. The first deletes a split or
	transaction, as expected. The second handles what was an odd
	corner case of the delete command, and removes all splits except
	for the one attached to the current register. This is now called
	the "reinitialize" function. (Fixes 85904).

	* src/register/ledger-core/split-register.h: 
	* src/register/ledger-core/split-register-p.h: Make
	gnc_split_register_get_current_trans_split() a public function.

	* src/register/ledger-core/split-register.c
	(gnc_split_register_empty_current_trans_except_split): New
	function that lets you specify which split to keep when
	reinitializing a transaction.

	* src/gnome-utils/gnc-gui-query.c: Add a couple more variant ways
	to create a dialog box.  At some point these should all be cleaned
	up and maybe made a subclass of a gnome dialog.

	* src/register/ledger-core/gnc-regwidget.c:
	* src/engine/Transaction.c: Move trans_has_reconciled_splits()
	function from one file to another and rename it
	xaccTransHasReconciledSplits().

2002-10-24  Christian Stimming  <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* src/gnome/window-acct-tree.c,
	src/import-export/hbci/gncmod-hbci.c: fix more menu item strings.

2002-10-23  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>
	* de.po: fix a string for Christian so it compiles.

	* new translations require leading underscores for menu names
	  or the lookups fail when adding new menus.  In particular,
	  "_Actions", "_Toolbar", and "_Status Bar".

	* gnc-backend-file.c: make sure a file HAS a date before actually
	  removing it.  Otherwise you will remove a foo.xac file by accident.
	
2002-10-22  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>
   Fix a bunch of compiler warnings:
	* Transaction-matcher.c: use "=" not "==" to set a variable

	(gnc_dense_cal_mark)
	(gnc_dense_cal_mark_remove): Queue a re-draw when marks are added
	or removed; fixes Bug#96468.

	* src/gnome-utils/gnc-frequency.c (year_range_sels_changed): Emit
	"changed" signal when the year-range selections change; fixes
	Bug#96470.

	* src/gnome/dialog-scheduledxaction.c (gnc_sxed_check_consistent):
	Free the name str after we've used it [conrad-found, unfiled bug].

	* src/gnome-utils/gnc-dense-cal.c (populate_hover_window): Now
	more tolerant of mark sets without names.

	* src/gnome/druid-loan.c:

	MenuItem for loan-repayment druid as per Chris' suggestion.

	* configure.in -- remove -Wno-uninitialized -Wno-unused, in preparation
	  for the "new g-wrap" which should output code that wont cause these
	  warnings.
	
	* gnc-vendor-xml-v2.c, test-customer.c, test-vendor.c -- fix compiler
	  warnings.
	* dialog-options.c -- remove unused variable
	* gnc-regwidget.c -- remove unused (module) variable

	* Peter O'Gorman's MacOS patch
	  This is mostly just a bunch of libgncmod_name_LTX_ symbol changes to
	  the modules.
	  Also had to remove -Werror from hbci/Makefile.am due to darn cc
	  warnings about order of includes.
	
2002-10-20  Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>

	* src/app-utils/gnc-exp-parser.c (gnc_exp_parser_parse): This

	system. Clean up the code somewhat. #95787

	* src/gnome/reconcile-list.c (gnc_reconcile_list_select_row):
	(gnc_reconcile_list_unselect_row): If the user pressed the space

	of the transaction.  This lets the user toggle successive
	transactions by repeatedly pressing the space bar (instead of
	alternating the space and the down arrow key.)

	* src/test-core and src/engine/test-core should not be added to

	  work on all versions of auto-tools, although it now requires GnuMake.
	
	* configure.in -- just pass LIBOBJS directly to the Makefile; pass
	  a sed script that uses '$U' (which is a 2.53ism, but works right
	  on 2.13) to the Makefile.
	* lib/libc/Makefile.am -- Use LIBOBJS and GnuMake's $(shell) syntax
	  to create the list of libobjects to be linked into "libc-missing"

	src/gnome/window-reconcile.c: Add function to invoke account
	reconciliation with balance and date given.

2002-10-03  Derek Atkins <derek@ihtfp.com>

	  it needs to run before app-utils is loaded (because gnc_localeconv()
	  caches the first run -- so if that happens before setlocale, you're
	  stuck!)  fixes 89471 and partially fixes 87729

2002-10-02  Derek Atkins <derek@ihtfp.com>
	* configure.in: check for ltdl.h

	* qif-io-core/test/Makefile.am: add app-file and backend/file dirs to tests
	* fix test-import-phase-1.scm: load app-file for symbols, fix

	* src/engine/SchedXaction.c (gnc_sx_add_defer_instance)
	(_temporal_state_data_cmp, gnc_sx_remove_defer_instance)
	(gnc_sx_get_defer_instances):
	Added and modified to support postponing to-be-created SXes; fixes
	Bug#88981.

	* src/import-export/ofx/gnc-ofx-import.c: The default commodity
	and account type are now preselected from OFX provided information
	when user choses to creates a new gnucash account in the account
	matcher dialog.  Fix a segfault when clicking cancel in the file
	selection dialog.

	* src/import-export/Account-matcher.c, gnc-generic-import.h:
	-Fix the new_account_default_type parameter of
	gnc_import_select_account() not selecting default type properly.
	-Add auto_create parameter to gnc_import_select_account().  
	If this parameter is 0 and the function is called, it will silently
	return NULL if no matching account is found, instead of asking the
	user to select or create an account.
	-Clicking cancel will now cancel the import for the whole account

	* src/engine/gnc-session.c (gnc_session_load): 
	(gnc_session_save): Added a callback for percentage done.

	* src/import-export/hbci/*: much more HBCI work. Ini-Letter of
	user can already be printed. However no information is *sent* to
	the bank or saved to disk so far, so everybody can play around as
	you like. 

2002-08-14  Joachim Breitner <mail@joachim-breitner.de>

	It may not be appropriate for a newcomer in the gnucash community
	like me, but could you please please include this simple patch in

	the only source that has the German Deka-Fonts.

2002-08-14  David Hampton  <hampton@employees.org>

	* business-gnome/Makefile.am: cross-link the business-core

	* src/import-export/hbci/hbci-interaction.[hc]: Add code for
	HBCI_API interaction. Will be migrated to gnucash-UI's code
	soon. Recent changes to HBCI code require yet another update to
	current OpenHBCI CVS.

	more parts of HBCI setup. Requires update to current OpenHBCI CVS,
	though.

	(int_cmp), (_gnc_freq_spec_get_min): Added to support ordering
	FreqSpecs for sorting.

	* src/gnome/dialog-scheduledxaction.c: Added support for
	column-sorting the SX list, resolving Bug#87865 fixed.  Cleaned up
	GDate allocation when done with them.  Fixed Bug#90326 relating to
	next-instance-date calculation, which was b0rken when the
	dense-calendar was added in cases where the next SX instance is
	outside of the visible calendar range.

2002-08-06  Joshua Sled  <jsled@asynchronous.org>

	* src/gnome/dialog-sxsincelast.c: Added support for saving the

	appropriate.
	(create_each_transaction_helper): Fixed a nasty problem with
	freeing a static string.
	(sxsincelast_populate): Be better about cleaning up after ourself
	during the initial instance generation.  Be better about writing
	clean, generic code.
	(processSelectedReminderList): Be better about writing clean,
	generic code.
	(to_create_prep): Empty the variable table when we transition into
	the page; closes Bug#84689.

	* src/import-export/gnc-generic-import.h: Clarified docs.

	* src/engine/kvp_frame.h: Clarified doc about kvp_value_get_string
	(which is in fact non-copying.)

	* src/gnome/dialog-sxsincelast.c (to_create_next): Fix for
	re-creating to-create transactions when the variables change;
	fixes Bug#89924.  Fixed another small bug in the variable-table
	handling code.

2002-08-05  Joshua Sled  <jsled@asynchronous.org>

	* src/import-export/gnc-generic-import.c: #if-def'd out the
	original version, and replaced with a version sans the printf.
	For some reason, with the printf, GCC 3.1 can't compile this file.

	* src/gnome/dialog-sxsincelast.c: Added support for the Back [and
	Next] button to behave correctly in the Druid.  Closes Bug#84688.
	Fixed a double-freeing bug [Bug#89475].  Correct use of
	gnc_{suspend,resume}_gui_refresh makes Transaction processing much
	faster, closing Bug#84686.

	* src/scm/main.scm: Add module-load for HBCI.

	* src/import-export/hbci/*: Thanks to Benoit Gregoire, the initial
	HBCI druid is at least visible now. Still no code that would
	really do anything, though.

2002-07-27  Christian Stimming  <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* configure.in: Add --enable-hbci configure option.

	* src/import-export/hbci/*: More HBCI GUI work. Some druid should
	be visible by now. The code doesn't really do anything so far,
	though.

2002-07-24  Joshua Sled  <jsled@asynchronous.org>

	* src/register/ledger-core/gnc-ledger-display.c
	(gnc_ledger_display_gl): Added filter for template
	transaction-accounts to General Ledger, fixing Bug 86302.

	* src/gnome/dialog-scheduledxaction.c (gnc_sxed_check_consistent):
	Changed wording to fix half of Bug 87622 [the other half being
	unreproducible :(].

	* src/gnome/dialog-sx-from-trans.c (sxftd_update_fs): Add support
	for Bi-Weekly to be part of the pull-down; fixes half of
	Bug 88178.

	* src/engine/FreqSpec.c (xaccFreqSpecGetWeekly): Keep the returned
	day-of-week within reasonable bounds.
	(xaccFreqSpecGetFreqStr): s/Anually/Yearly/ [sic] - Bug 88176.

	* src/gnome/glade/sched-xact.glade: Dead-UI
	removal. s/Anually/Yearly/ [sic] - Fixes Bug 88176.

2002-07-24  Joshua Sled  <jsled@asynchronous.org>

	* src/scm/fin.scm: Made the exposed calculation functions output
	positive values.

	* src/gnome/window-main.c (gnc_main_window_create_menus): Added
	accelerators to SX-related menu items.

	* src/gnome/druid-loan.c: Primary change: actually create the
	Scheduled Transactions which are setup by the user.  Miscellaneous
	other cleanups, text, layout and consistency changes.

	* src/gnome/dialog-sxsincelast.c: Support handling of the
	instance-count in forward-looking transaction creation.  Simplified
	some of the internal data-representation regarding lists of items
	to be created [removed autoCreateTuple, now uses toCreateTuple].
	Removed some DEBUGging output.  Handles setting up the implicit
	'i' variable.

	* src/gnome/dialog-sx-from-trans.c (sxftd_compute_sx): Create SXes
	with an appropriate initial instance-count value.
	
	* src/gnome/dialog-scheduledxaction.c
	(schedXact_editor_populate): Create SXes with an appropriate
	initial instance-count value.

	* src/engine/SchedXaction.[ch]: Added support for an
	instance-count, in order to support an implicit 'i' [of N]
	variable to SX formula/function processing.
	
	* src/engine/SX-ttinfo.c (gnc_ttsplitinfo_free): Made the
	ttsplitinfo_free'ing a bit safer.

	* src/calculation/expression_parser.c: Added support for
	parsing/handling quoted strings.  Intended to be parameters to
	functions.  Fixed bug regarding nested handling of strings in the
	parser.

	* src/backend/file/gnc-schedxaction-xml-v2.c: Added support for
	saving/restoring instance-count field of SXes.

	* src/app-utils/test/test-exp-parser.c

	(test_parser): Added tests for string params to functions.

	* ChangeLog: Added entry I forgot from last time.
	
	* src/app-utils/gnc-exp-parser.c (func_op): Added support for
	typed parameters to functions; params are either numerics or
	strings.  Result of function is now parsed correctly.

2002-07-24  Christian Stimming  <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* src/import-export/hbci/glade/hbci.glade: Some HBCI GUI work --
	still no real code yet.

2002-07-21  Christian Stimming  <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* src/app-utils/guile-util.c (gnc_get_debit_string): Fix by Matt
	Armstrong <matt@lickey.com> : Look for "Use accounting labels"
	option is under the "Accounts" section.

	* src/backend/file/gnc-backend-file.c: File permission fix by Matt
	Brubeck <mbrubeck@cs.hmc.edu>

2002-07-12  Joshua Sled  <jsled@asynchronous.org>

	* src/gnome/glade/sched-xact.glade: Glade-side UI cleanup.

	* src/gnome/druid-loan.c: Many updates; now uses GNCAccountSel,
	more inter-page consistency checks. UI cleanup

	* src/gnome-utils/gnc-account-sel.[ch]: Added; GTK combobox for
	selecting an Account.

2002-07-11  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* change gncEntry->account into gncEntry->invAccount and
	  gncEntry->billAccount.  Change the register so that Bills use
	  the BillAccount and Invoices use the InvoiceAccount.  This
	  allows the same Entry to have both an "expense" and "income"
	  account to offset each other.

2002-07-10  Joshua Sled  <jsled@asynchronous.org>

	* src/gnome/druid-loan.[ch]: Added; Initial implementation of
	Gnome Druid for setting up loan-repayment Scheduled Transactions.
	
	* src/doc/loans.txt: Added; notes about how loans will be dealt
	with in GnuCash.
	
	* src/gnome/glade/sched-xact.glade: Added loan-druid.
	
	* src/gnome/window-main.c (gnc_main_window_create_menus): Added

	* src/scm/fin.scm: Added. Implementations of 'ipmt', 'ppmt', 'pmt'
	and supporting code.
	
	* src/app-utils/test/test-exp-parser.c (test_parser): Added tests
	for functions-in-expressions.  Added [passed] test for Conrad's
	bug.

	* src/app-utils/gnc-exp-parser.c (func_op): Added. gnc-side
	callback for dealing with a function in an expression.

	* src/calculation/expression_parser.c: Added initial, undocumented
	support for functions in expressions.

2002-07-10  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* add Billable flag and Bill-To (owner) to line-item entries.
	* save these flags only if the entry is attached to a Bill.
	* add a Billable column to Bill register

	* add gncQueryAddBooleanMatch() convenience function

	* add a BillTo owner in the GncInvoice object.  Save it in XML if
	  it's non-empty.

	* modify the Entry Ledger query to pull in Billable Entries from
	  Posted Bills that belong to an Invoice's Owner.

	* business-prefs: add the bill_reg_width preference to save the value
	* implement "Default Project" in the Bill register to enter a
	  default Bill-to customer/job.  It's only visible on Bills, not
	  Invoices.
	
2002-07-09  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihftp.com>

	* "global-replace for-each-in-order for-each" because the former
	  does not exist in current guiles.  Fixes bugID 87693

	* add "centered-label-cell" markup type to define a cell with tag
	  'b' and attribute "align center".

	* owner-report.scm: add a due-date column; change "Invoice" to
	  "Bill" for vendor reports.  Fix the aging table.  Reverse the
	  numerics for vendor reports.

	* prefs.scm: change A/P's "Invoice" column header to "Bill"

	* Separate Bills and Invoices into (somewhat) different things.
	  An Entry now has pointers to an Invoice and a Bill, although
	  both are represented by a GncInvoice.  Force a GncInvoice to a
	  Bill if the owner is a Vendor.  (It's a regular Invoice if the
	  owner is a Customer).  Eventually we can support Owner ==
	  Employee to deal with Expense Reports.
	* gncInvoice: add gncBill{Add,Remove}Entry
	* gncEntry: add gncEntry{Get,Set}Bill
	* gw-business-core: wrap gncEntryGetBill
	* gnc-entry-xml-v2: add entry:bill pointer
	* gncEntryLedger: deal with Bill Entry.  Don't need a lot of
	  columns (compared to Invoices).  This is not complete, but is
	  at a workable point now.
	* dialog-invoice: call the BILL vs. INVOICE entry-ledger based
	  on the invoice owner.
	
2002-07-08  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* kvp-option-registry.scm: create a registry of kvp-options
	  generators for various objects.  This simplifies the distributed
	  generation of kvp-option dialogs.
	* app-utils.scm: export kvp-option-registry functions
	* option-util: add option_db_changed() function
	* business-gnome.scm: add "File -> File Preferences" menu item
	  which is the kvp-option dialog for the Book.
	* business-prefs.scm: register a kvp-option generator for gnc:id-book 
	* gnc-book: add gnc_book_kvp_changed() function
	* gw-engine-spec.scm: wrap gnc_book_kvp_changed
	* dialog-options.c: only call the SCM apply_cb if the optiondb
	  actually changed.
	* gnome-utils.scm: create gnc:kvp-option-dialog procedure to create
	  an kvp-option dialog for the specified type.  Export this procedure.

2002-07-07  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* options.scm: change gnc:make-option; add two new args, scm->kvp
	  and kvp->scp.  Implement these two methods for most of the options.
	* app-utils.scm: export the kvp->scm and scm->kvp procedures
	* business-options.scm: Implement the kvp->scm and scm->kvp methods
	  for the business options.

	  <gnc:Session*> instead of a string.
	* binary-import.scm: fix the book-opened-hook.
	* main-window.scm: fix the book-opened/closed-hook calls
	* main.scm: fix the book-opened/closed-hook calls	  

	* gw-app-utils-spec.scm: wrap <gnc:OptionDB*>, option_db_new,
	  option_db_destroy()
	* options.scm: fix scm->kvp method; fix a typo; add clear-kvp?
	  argument to gnc:options-scm->kvp for whether to clear out the
	  kvp before saving it.
	* business-gnome.scm: add code to test the kvp option-dialog
	* kvp-scm.c: fix the delete_at_path() function to actually work right.
	* dialog-options: create a function (and support routines) to 
	  use SCM apply_cb and close_cb callback functions:
	  options_dialog_set_callbacks()
	* gw-gnome-utils-spec.scm: wrap <gnc:OptionWin*>, options_dialog_new(),
	  options_dialog_destroy(), options_dialog_build_contents(), and
	  options_dialog_set_callbacks()
	
2002-07-06  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* gw-kvp-spec.scm: wrap kvp_slot_set_slot_path_gslist(),
	  kvp_slot_get_slot_path_gslist(), and gnc_book_get_slots()

	* kvp-scm: create gnc_kvp_frame_delete_at_path() and wrap it.
	  This function will clear a sub-tree out of a kvp_frame.	  

	* kvp-scm: implement KVP_TYPE_FRAME kvp-values

	* gw-engine-spec.scm: wrap gnc_session_get_url(), in preparation
	  for changing the book-opened-hook and book-closed-hook

	* gw-engine-spec.scm: wrap gnc_lot_get_split_list
	* gw-business-core-spec.scm: wrap gncInvoiceGetPosted{Acc,Txn,Lot}

	* invoice.scm: add the ability to show the payments applied to
	  the invoice
	
2002-07-04  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* option-util.c: add gnc_option_get_option_data() function
	* dialog-options: publish gnc_options_dialog_changed_internal() so
	  pluggable options can set the flag, too.

	* business-options: (new files) implement owner/customer/vendor
	  options to plug into the options dialog.
	* businessmod-gnome: initialize business options
	* business-utils: pack into box FALSE, not TRUE
	* owner-report: put the company into the options dialog instead of
	  hiding it.

	* business-core.scm: fix a typo
	* business-options.c: implement invoice option for the dialog
	* gncEntryLedgerLoad.c: fix a compiler warning
	* invoice.scm: make report visible; deal with no invoice; make
	  invoice a visible option on the general page; deal with "printing"
	  un-posted invoices.
	* receivables.scm: remove code I don't need
	
2002-07-03  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* moved receivable and payable aging reports to business-reports;
	added "links" to the company, invoices, and company-report.
	Create a "Business Reports" menu item under "Reports" and put the
	business reports there.  This required a new startup hook to allow
	dynamic creation of the Report Menu.  Change the aging reports to
	use Invoices and Lots instead of the transaction description to
	differentiate actual companies.

	* dialog-invoice: publish the function to open a company-report

	* business-urls: hooks into gnc-html for business objects.
	Initialize at module load-time.  wrap the business url types.

	* business-core: create gnc:owner-from-split which is used by a
	bunch of the business reports.  wrap gncOwnerCopy().

	* fix the "Create Test Data" extension
	
2002-07-03  Christian Stimming  <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* src/gnome/druid-hierarchy.c (gnc_get_ea_locale_dir): If current
	locale doesn't work for account hierarchy druid, then check all
	abbreviated versions of that locale.

2002-07-02  David Hampton  <hampton@employees.org>

	* src/app-utils/gnc-ui-util.c (PrintAmountInternal): If the "auto
	decimal places" option has been set, force all numbers to be
	printed with that many decimal places.  That will prevent multiple
	conversion of a cell (e.g. 1234.00 => 1234 => 12.34) as a user
	tabs in and out of a cell.

2002-07-02  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* register/register-gnome/gnucash-sheet.c: allow a caller to
	"unset" the popup menu by passing a NULL popup.

	* business/business-gnome/dialog-invoice.c: use glade for the
	popup.  Only set the popup for Read-Write invoices.
	* business/business-gnome/glade/invoice.glade: define the popup
	menu in glade.

	* add a menubar to the Invoice Window in glade

	* fill out the Invoice Window Menu, based upon the Register
	Window.  Fill in the callbacks required to get the menu to work.

	* Create a hook into the "owner-report" and link that into the
	Invoice Window, so you can print the report from any Invoice.

	* add a hook in the entry ledger to obtain the current Query (to
	set the sort order).

	* options.scm: Create gnc:make-account-list-limited-option
	function that adds a list of valid account-types; this limits the
	account-tree dialog to only "reasonable" accounts.

	* option-util.[ch]: add function to obtain GList* of valid
	account-types.  NULL means "all".

	* dialog-options: Limit account-list by types.

	* Update payables and receivables reports to limit account types.
	
2002-07-01  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* business-gnome/dialog-invoice.c: make all my callbacks
	non-static; remove the toolbar creation code.
	* business-gnome/glade/invoice.glade: create the toolbar in glade.
	
2002-07-01  Joshua Sled  <jsled@asynchronous.org>

	* src/gnome/dialog-scheduledxaction.c:
	* src/gnome/dialog-sxsincelast.c: 
	* src/app-utils/prefs.scm: Added options/code-support for
	saving/restoring sizes of SX-related windows.  Fixes bug 86007.

2002-07-01  Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>
	* Convert all (well, most all) HTML URL-generators to use
	gnc_build_url() (or gnc:html-build-url in scheme) instead of
	assuming the HTML prototype string.  Unfortunately the
	help-window-index.scm cannot be fixed.

2002-07-01  Joshua Sled  <jsled@asynchronous.org>

	* src/gnome-utils/gnc-dense-cal.c (gnc_dense_cal_mark_remove):
	Unrealistic marks [such as '-1'] are now ignored instead of
	hitting assertion.

	* src/gnome/dialog-scheduledxaction.c: Dead code removal; naming
	clarifications.
	(gnc_sxed_check_consistent): Added.
	(gnc_sxed_check_changed): Added; used when the cancel button is
	pressed.  SX editor now queries the user if the SX has changed.
	(gnc_sxed_save_sx): Added; separated from consistency-check.
	(_gnc_sxed_get_widgets): Added; many glade_xml_get_widget(...)s
	removed from code.
	(free_var_numeric): Added; we now cleanup the temporary variable
	table correctly after doing balance checking.
	(schedXact_editor_create_ledger): RegWidget toolbar shouldn't
	expand; fixed.
	(putSchedXactionInDialog): Fixed assertion-failure/abort when a
	previously-unscheduled SX is scheduled.

	* src/engine/SchedXaction.c (xaccSchedXactionGetNextInstance),
	(xaccSchedXactionGetInstanceAfter): Fixed bug in
	number-of-occurrence instance-state processing.

	* src/register/ledger-core/gnc-regwidget.c: 
	* src/gnome/dialog-schedxaction.c:
	* src/gnome/dialog-sxsincelast.c:
	* src/engine/SchedXaction.[ch]:
	* src/engine/FreqSpec.[ch]: Dead code removal/cleanup.

2002-07-01  Derek Atkins   <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* gnc-html: convert URLType from enum to char*
	* gw-gnome-utils-spec: wrap URLType type, #defines, and gnc_build_url()
	* get the rest of the C code to use URLTypes properly

	* fix the business XML to use symbolic names for enums (instead of
	their integer values).  This is an incompatible change -- old
	business XML objects will not load properly.
	
2002-06-29  David Hampton  <hampton@employees.org>

	* configure.in:
	* src/gnome/gnc-splash.c (gnc_show_splash_screen): Add the current
	version number (or cvs build time) to the splash screen.

2002-06-27  Derek Atkins   <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* Change the "Owner Report" to a "Customer Report" and "Vendor
	Report" Create a plug-in system to plug reports into the Register
	Window, keyed off of the account type and whether a split exists
	(for a "Transaction" report).  This required changes to the
	payables and receivables (aging) reports.

	* Tie the Customer and Vendor reports in, so you can bring up a
	Customer Report by selecting a transaction in an A/R account and
	clicking on Reports -> Transaction Report.

	* Create an "owner-report" which prints out a set of Invoice and
	Payment transactions and also an aging report for a single "owner"
	(e.g. Customer or Vendor).  This is still a first pass, so it
	might not be correct.  It uses Lots, but it assumes that the
	Account is periodically closed and re-opened (does not have a
	'start-date').  It still needs to be tied into the main GUI.

	* gncJob: add gncJobRetGUID() and gncJobLookupDirect()

	* gncOwner: add gncOwnerRetGUID()

	* gw-business-core-spec.scm: wrap GncAmountType, GncTaxIncluded
	GncBillTermType, gncInvoiceGetInvoiceFromLot(), gncJobRetGUID(),
	jobJobLookupDirect(), gncOwnerGetEndOwner(),
	gncOwnerGetOwnerFromLot(), gncOwnerRetGUID()

	* business-gnome.scm: add extensions to test the owner-report

	* business-options.scm: add an "owner" option-type

2002-06-25  Derek Atkins   <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* gncOwner.[ch]: Provide functions to store/lookup an owner in a
	Lot's kvp_frame.

	* gncInvoice.c: add implementation of GetPostedLot(); when posting
	to an Account, look for any pre-payment Lots and post to that.  If
	the Invoice total < pre-payment, then automatically forward the
	payments to a future Lot.  If no pre-payment Lot is found, then
	create a new one.

	* dialog-payment.c: force payment amounts to be positive values
	(you cannot un-pay via this dialog).  Apply payments to open
	Invoice Lots in a FIFO manner (by Due Date).  If there is anything
	left over, then create a pre-payment Lot.

2002-06-24  David Hampton  <hampton@employees.org>

	* src/import-export/ofx/Makefile.am:
	* src/import-export/ofx/README:
	* src/import-export/ofx/gnc-ofx-import.c:
	* src/import-export/ofx/gnc-ofx-import.h:
	* src/import-export/ofx/gncmod-ofx-import.c:
	* src/import-export/ofx/ofx-import.scm: Benoit Gregoire's changes
	to make the OFX import module build its own menu item at runtime.
	
	* src/gnome-utils/gnc-mdi-utils.c: 
	* src/gnome/dialog-price-edit-db.c: 
	* src/gnome/window-acct-tree.c: 
	* src/gnome/window-main.c: Fix parameter names in documentation.

2002-06-23  Joshua Sled  <jsled@asynchronous.org>

	* src/gnome/dialog-sxsincelast.c: Lists of SX instances [the
	Reminders and To-Create] are now trees instead of clists.
	Better structure of internal state.
	Fixed multiple-SX-reminder selection/processing bug [Bug#85997].

2002-06-22  David Hampton  <hampton@employees.org>

	* src/gnc-module/gnc-module.{c,h,scm} :
	* src/gnc-module/gw-gnc-module-spec.scm : Add support for loading
	an optional module.  I.E. Don't complain if you can't find it.

	* src/gnome/window-main.c : Add a File/Import submenu that will
	contain entries for QIF, OFX, etc.

	* src/import-export/Makefile.am :
	* src/import-export/gncmod-generic-import.c :
	* src/import-export/ofx/gnc-ofx-import.c :

	gnc_add_c_extension function. Rename the existing
	gnc_add_extension to gnc_add_scm_extension.

	* src/gnome/window-main.c:
	* src/import-export/qif-import/druid-qif-import.[ch]:
	* src/import-export/qif-import/gncmod-qif-import.c: Create the
	"Import QIF" menu item from within the QIF module.

2002-06-21  Derek Atkins   <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* integrate the Billing Terms into the Core, GUI, and XML Backend
	for the rest of the business objects that need billing terms.

	* .../business-core/gncBillTerm*.[ch]: Add Billing Term objects.
	Currently there are "Days" and "Proximo" billing terms available.

	* .../business-core/file/gnc-bill-term*: XML Backend storage for
	Billing Terms.

	* .../business-gnome/dialog-bill-terms.[ch]: Dialog to create,
	view, and edit Billing Terms.

	* .../business-gnome/business-prefs.scm: move the business
	preferences (default option creation) to its own scheme file.
	
2002-06-20  David Hampton  <hampton@employees.org>

	* src/engine/Transaction.[ch]: New function

	* src/import-export/<blah>:
	* src/import-export/ofx/<blah>: Benoit Gregoire's initial support
	for OFX import.

2002-06-18  Joshua Sled  <jsled@asynchronous.org>

	* src/gnome-utils/gnc-dense-cal.[ch]: Added; a multiply-markable,
	visually-dense Gtk calendar widget, to be used by
	Scheduled Transactions.

	* src/gnome/dialog-scheduledxaction.c
	(putSchedXactionInDialog): Renamed; supports marking the new
	GncDenseCal.
	(delete_button_clicked): Now much less lame about dealing with the
	CList when items are removed; supports [un]marking the
	GncDenseCal.

	* src/gnome/dialog-scheduledxaction.c (editor_ok_button_clicked):
	Query the user if they want to create an unbalanceable
	[variable-containing] transaction. Inform the user if they try to
	create an auto-create transaction which has variables, as this is
	not allowed.
	

2002-06-18  David Hampton  <hampton@employees.org>

	* src/gnome/window-main.c: Make a couple of functions globally
	visible.
	
	* src/gnome/window-register.c:
	* src/gnome/glade/register.glade: Reorganize the menus in the
	register window.  Convert the register window over to a glade
	based window using glade_xml_signal_autoconnect.  Rename a bunch
	of short named function to the form gnc_register_xxx to insure
	uniqueness.
	
2002-06-16  Derek Atkins   <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* Refactor a lot of the business code.  Move the tax-table dialog
	to its own directory/gnc-module.  Move the business-gnome glade
	files to their own directory.  Create a business-reports directory
	for the current and future business reports.

	* Move to invoice report into business-reports (it _IS_ a business
	report after all).  Add a business-reports guile module, and get
	it all to work.  Fix the gnucash-build-env script to look in the
	new directories.

2002-06-16  Derek Atkins   <derek@ihtfp.com>

	Integrate the tax table into the gncEntry object; change how taxes
	and discounts are computed, stored, and returned.  Fix the Entry

	create and edit tax tables.  G-wrap the editor-window create
	routine.

	* business-gnome.scm: add the Tax Table gui; rename the 'Invoice'
	option page to "Business".  Fix dialog-invoice to use the new
	option name.

	* src/gnome/window-main.c: Update the view items to use
	gtkcheckmenuitems instead of having separate show and hide menu
	items.  Also flip the order of the Summary and Status menu items
	so that the menu order reflects the items order within the window.

2002-06-09  David Hampton  <hampton@employees.org>

	* src/app-file/gnome/gnc-file-history.c (gnc_history_update_menu):
	Move the file history items into a sub-menu of the file menu.

	* src/gnome/window-acct-tree.c: Menu/toolbar items are now

	application window menus.

	* src/gnome/window-main.c: Reorganize the menubar in the main
	window.  Add support for dispatching top level menu items to
	functions that operate on contained views (i,e, on a report).

	* src/gnome/window-register.c: Start reorganizing the menubar in
	the register window.

	* src/gnome-utils/gnc-mdi-utils.[ch]: Add new functions for
	finding/manipulating menu/toolbar items on the fly.  Add support

	don't need to run GnuCash with GNC_DEBUG=1 in order to use the
	business functionality.

2002-06-05  Derek Atkins   <derek@ihtfp.com>

	Integration of the new Query subsystem, to replace the old Query
	infrastructure.  This also replaces the old "Find Transaction"
	dialog with the new gnome-search dialog.  Registers, Reports, SXs,
	etc. all test out fine.  Integration with SQL has been "done"
	(i.e. it compiles cleanly) but not "tested."  Lots of the old code
	is still there, but #ifdef'ed out.  That code will go away
	shortly.

	There is only one known loss-of-functionality: the query->xml-v1
	converter was not re-implemented.  The current intention is, if
	this functionality is required, to use the query->scm converter
	and then convert the scm->string and insert that into an XML
	document.

	Fix a Transaction Void bug.
	
	Fix a few bugs in test code.

2002-06-04  David Hampton  <hampton@employees.org>

	* src/gnome-utils/gnc-mdi-utils.c (gnc_mdi_destroy): Work around a

	* src/gnome/reconcile-list.c: Fix the direction of the sort
	arrows.

	* src/gnome-utils/dialog-options.c: Preferences dialogs will now

	box instead of a vertical one.

	* src/gnome-utils/gnc-html.c:
	* src/gnome-utils/gw-gnome-utils-spec.scm:
	* src/gnome-utils/print-session.[ch]:

	* src/app-utils/option-util.c: Add a function to reset all the gui
	widgets for an option-db, ignoring sections that begin "__".

	* dialog-options.c: remove all the 'set to default' buttons and
	add a single 'defaults' button in the dialog button box, which
	resets all the options to their default values.  The user still
	has to 'apply' the changes to take effect.  Also change "close" to
	"cancel".

2002-05-27  David Hampton  <hampton@employees.org>

	* src/dialog-account/dialog-account.c: Sort the account type list

	to its own page
	
2002-05-26  Derek Atkins   <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/gnome-util/dialog-options.[ch]: Create an option-type
	database so that modules can define new option-types and plug them
	into Gnucash.  Break apart the existing "if type == blah; else if
	type == blah blah..." code and use the new options-type database.
	New options require the implementation of three functions,
	set_widget(), set_value(), and get_value().
	
2002-05-24  Derek Atkins   <derek@ihtfp.com>

	* src/engine/GNCId.c: Implement xaccForeachEntity() as a which
	allows a traversal of all entities of a particular type.

	* Register GncObject_t descriptions for Splits, Transactions, and

	increasing and decreasing.

	* src/gnome/window-reconcile.c: Remove all list sorting logic.

	* src/gnome-utils/gnc-amount-edit.c: Reparent the amount editor
	widget so it is based upon a GtkEntry.  This allows trivial
	GtkEntry <-> GncAmountEdit conversions.

	* src/gnome/dialog-fincalc.c: Clean up code that uses a
	GncAmountEdit widget as a GtkEntry widget.

	* src/gnome/dialog-find-transactions.c
	(gnc_ui_find_transactions_dialog_create): Make all the editable
	fields trigger the dialog default button when <enter> is pressed.

	* po/Makevars: New file required by gettext 0.11.

2002-05-13   Derek Atkins   <derek@ihtfp.com>

	Change the Search Dialog to use a CList and allow each object to
	provide its own column list for displaying search results.  Change
	the interface to require the list of columns.  Modify all the
	business dialogs to use the new search interface.

	Add a new interface to the QueryCore to convert any Core object
	into a string (or have it return NULL)

2002-05-09   Derek Atkins   <derek@ihtfp.com>

	Change the Date-Close dialog to use gnc-date-edit instead of the
	gnome-date-edit widget set.

	removed unused dialogs from job.glade and invoice.glade

	returned lost invoice functionality: open the invoice-register
	window when you 'ok' a new invoice.
	
2002-05-09   Derek Atkins   <derek@ihtfp.com>

	Fixed dialog-order.  Should now complain less during compilation.

2002-05-09  Derek Atkins   <derek@ihtfp.com>

	Create a new general_search widget that hooks into the search
	dialog and provides callbacks and signals for object selection.
	This fixes a lot of the nested-gtk_main() problems in the business
	code.  Still more separation to do, but MOST of the main modules
	are changed to use the new interfaces.  This is an interim commit;
	another commit will follow shortly.  The code works now, but
	dialog-order (in particular) will give you compiler warnings.

2002-05-07  David Hampton  <hampton@employees.org>

	Pogma's Mac OS X patches committed.  Added a new directory
	src/lib/libc for library routines not available on Mac OS X.
	Changed all of the module function names required by gnucash
	according to libltdl rules so that they are unique, though they
	all still appear the same to callers of libltdl.

	type of URL, a gnc-price url.

	* src/report/standard-reports/portfolio.scm: The price of a stock
	is now a hyperlink which brings up an "edit a single price" dialog
	for that stock price.  Added an option for skipping stocks with a
	zero share balance.

	* rpm/gnucash.spec.in: Added more dependency information. Added
	support for building an additional RPM containing only the
	postgres backend files.

	* ChangeLog: Spell check this file.

	* src/engine/Account.[c,h]: New routines to get/save last
	reconciliation interval.

	* src/engine/date.[c,h]: New routines for manipulating dates.

	specified for next time.

	* src/app-utils/prefs.scm:
	* src/engine/date.c: 
	* src/gnome/top-level.c (gnc_configure_date_format): Change the
	default date format to be the user's LOCALE setting.

	* src/engine/date.c (scanDate): Totally work over this routine to
	support a user entering one, two, or three numbers. If one, assume
	day.  If two assume day/month, ordering from locale. Three is
	day/month/year, ordering from locale.  Also protect against an old
	date string being supplied to the routine after the date format
	has been changed.

	* src/register/register-gnome/datecell-gnome.c
	(gnc_date_cell_leave): Reprint the time when leaving a date_cell

2002-04-21  Joshua Sled  <jsled@asynchronous.org>

	* src/gnome/dialog-sx-from-trans.c (sxftd_advanced_clicked): Since
	"Advanced..." editing completely entails the from-transaction
	dialog, we close it if the user selects "Advanced..." to prevent
	errors when the from-trans dialog is "Ok"'d.

	* src/gnome/dialog-scheduledxaction.c (delete_button_clicked):
	Better deletion confirmation checking; we now look for
	being-edited scheduled transactions and confirm them specially
	with the user to prevent inconsistencies from cropping up.

	* src/doc/TODO-schedxactions: Updated; more 'X'-ed off items make
	me happy.

2002-03-04  Derek Atkins <warlord@MIT.EDU>

	* Plug-in Extensions for backends, so pluggable objects can
	provide backend-support without changing the core backend
	implementation.

	* src/engine/gncObject: Add a 'mark_clean' data-type method()
				add backend extension registration.

	* src/engine/gnc-book.c: use mark_clean object interface

	* src/backend/file/io-gncxml-v2: use the backend extensions

	* src/business/business-core/gnc*: add the mark_clean methods
					   add commodities to many objects

	* src/business/business-core/file: the XML backend extensions for
	business objects.

	* src/business/business-gnome/dialog-*: supply default commodities

	commodity-collector calling functions.

2002-02-08  Derek Atkins <warlord@MIT.EDU>

	available in the extensions menu to show how it works.  More to
	come as more core data types get supported.

2002-02-03  Derek Atkins <warlord@MIT.EDU>

	* Updated QueryNew interface.  Provide a GSList of terms in order
	to specify queries like "entry->order->owner->guid == XXX".
	Update the business objects to the new API.

	* Fix queryNew bug: various merging routines did not save the list
	of books.

2002-02-03  Derek Atkins <warlord@MIT.EDU>

	* src/engine/gncObject.c: core object registration.

	a book is created or destroyed.

	* src/engine/gnc-engine.c: initialize the object registration and

	* first revision of the "QueryNew" interface.  Note that the
	interface is not complete -- in fact, the API will be changing
	this afternoon, but I wanted a baseline (working) system checked
	into the repository.  Right now only the business code is using
	the new query -- the old query still exists, so you should see no
	functional difference in anything except the business code.

	overrides.

	* src/scm/main-window.scm: fix hooks usage to be idempotent --
	file should (re)load safely now.

	* src/scm/main.scm: migrate some loads to the top level - though
	to really do this right, we're going to need more explicit
	use-modules and gnc:module-load deps expressed everywhere.
	(gnc:find-file): new exported function.

	run, this should still become a module (guile or gnc).
	(gnc:initialize-tip-of-the-day): new function.
	(gnc:tip-of-the-day-startup-func): new function.

	* src/scm/build-config.scm.in: rename -dir_ variables to -path_

	code for default commodity table initialization.

	* src/engine/gnc-commodity.h
	(gnc_commodity_table_add_default_data): new prototype.

	* src/engine/gnc-commodity.c
	(gnc_commodity_table_add_default_data): new function -- populate a
	commodity table with the "default" commodities/namespaces.
	#includes the automatically generated code from
	iso-4217-currencies.

	* src/engine/engine-helpers.c
	(gnc_engine_commodity_table_new): removed.

	* src/engine/commodity-table.scm: migrate commodity table
	construction to be C-only.

	* src/gnome/dialog-sxsincelast.c: #include gnc-gui-query.h

	* src/bin/overrides/gnucash-build-env.in: add report-gnome to
	test-env.  Change envt vars to reflect new scheme:
	GNC_CONFIG_PATH, GNC_SHARE_PATH, and GNC_DOC_PATH. 

	* src/backend/postgres/test/test-db.c
	(db_file_url): find the postgres communication socket directory
	via envt var TEST_DB_SOCKET_DIR.

	* src/backend/postgres/test/db-control.sh: rework to communicate
	with postgres through a file system socket rather than a TCP
	connection so tests will work even on machines that don't allow
	TCP.  This was a little tricky because shell substitutions were
	fighting the PG_CTL "-o '-k x -p y'" syntax.

	* src/backend/postgres/test/Makefile.am
	(AM_CFLAGS): add GUILE_INCS.
	(TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): add TEST_DB_SOCKET_DIR.

	* intl-scm/Makefile.am (guile-strings.c): add top_srcdir.

	* configure.in (error-on-warning): make this the default.  I'm
	tired of having to fix missing #includes, mismatched types,
	etc. after an update so I can get back to work, but if anyone has
	a real problem with this, I'd be happy to reconsider.

	* src/scm/bootstrap.scm.in: deleted (a few days ago actually).

	is called after any report option is changed.  Both are optional.
	
	Also get rid of the concept of 'display-lists' for reports and
	let the displays update themselves with callbacks.  Get rid of 
	parents and children for the reports.

2001-04-12  Bill Gribble  <grib@billgribble.com>

	* Lots and lots of changes to support Gnome MDI.  And I thought it
	would be an easy way to get that toolbar problem fixed.  Short
	story is lots of function prototypes changed to reflect the notion
	that there is no longer a single top-level gnucash window or
	account tree.  41 files changed, which is too many for me to
	itemize :)

	* src/gnome/window-acct-tree.{c,h}: new file; the "account tree
	window" is the contents of the former main window.  Now you can
	have as many of them open as you want.  account trees and reports
	are the 2 kinds of "main window children" which MDI manages.

	* src/gnome/window-main-summarybar.{c,h}: new file.  I moved the
	summary bar stuff out of the account tree because there's one
	summary bar per top-level window but possible many account trees
	per top-level window.

	* src/gnome/window-main.c: this is not what it used to be at all.
	the main gnucash ui element is now a 'GnomeMDI'.  The only menus
	and toolbar items here are ones that are always visible in any
	top-level window.

	* src/scm/prefs/scm: acct tree prefs are treated differently (one
	options obj per acct tree) and are auto-saved and restored.

	* src/scm/report.scm: report options are auto saved and restored. 

	* src/scm/html-style-sheet.scm: so are style sheets. 

2001-04-12  James LewisMoss  <jimdres@mindspring.com>

	other report's options.

	* src/scm/report/report-list.scm: Renamed file.

	* src/scm/report/category-barchart.scm: Introduced some
	more generality such that this file also has a asset and liability
