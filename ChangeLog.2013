	* Bug 683881 Partial implementation.

2013-02-06 Mike Alexander 

	* Avoid a crash when entering invalid dates (e.g., enter "111" for a transaction date). gnc_parse_date is ignoring the return code from qof_scan_date which causes it to send uninitialized values to gnc_mktime which crashes if the date is too ridiculous. Presumably this worked before because mktime took anything without crashing.

	* Do a better job of calculating debit and credit fractions. Make gnc_split_register_set_cell_fractions agree with gnc_split_register_get_debcred_entry. If the account for a split changes recalculate the fractions.

2013-01-30 Mike Alexander 

	* Do a better job of prompting for an exchange rate only when needed. If the debit or credit value of a split changes, prompt for an exchange rate. Don't prompt for an exchange rate in a register that doesn't have a rate cell (and fix a bug so that it knows that portfolio registers don't have one). If the transaction has been autofilled and edited start with a nearby rate from the prices DB.  If it is an existing transaction start with the exchange rate it already has.

	* Don't store a negative reconcile interval.
