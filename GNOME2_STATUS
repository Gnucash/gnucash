# -*- reStructuredText -*-

This is a ad-hoc list of list of what works and doesn't work in the g2
port of gnucash.  The plan is to finish porting those parts of gnucash
that have already been started (i.e. new windowing system, account
tree, commodities tree, etc.), but not to port any additional features
unless absolutely required.  The clist/ctree widgets *do* still exist
in gtk2 and can be used, even though they've been marked as deprecated
and will disappear in a future release.  Its important to get this
release out the door and not stall it until all the deprecated
functionality has been removed.

            General Notes
========================================

- General

  - Window size/position not being saved or used.

    - We used to do this via Gnome MDI support, but now we will need to
      manage it ourselves. :/

  - Weird pango_layout_set_text "string not UTF-8" issues reported by Neil Williams:
    
    - http://lists.gnucash.org/pipermail/gnucash-devel/2005-March/012797.html

    - http://lists.gnucash.org/pipermail/gnucash-devel/2005-March/012824.html

- Main Window

  - Summary Bar

    - Summarybar restored into GncMainWindow UI; summary-select list does not
      respond to button-pressing.

    - View > Summary Bar (toggle) menu option has no effect.

  - File Menu

    - The "Open Recent" menu only has the first entry; the rest of the lines
      appear blank.

  - [low-priority] New registers should open in new top-level windows.

- Register Core - mostly functional

  - Insertion point not shown. (fix gnucash-item-edit.c)

  - The first time it is used, the account popup immediately selects the
    first account.  After that it functions normally.

  - selection of the date for the datecell seems to also select the
    transaction underneath the calendar, leading to the "this transaction has
    changed, do you want to save" dialog.

  - selection events on the combo-cells aren't working.

    (gnucash:26380): GLib-GObject-WARNING **: gsignal.c:989: no emission of
    signal "key-press-event" to stop for instance `0x855a240'

- Reconcile

  - Crash after initial value-prompting dialog:

- Find - mostly functional; creating a search creates a search results tab in
  the main window, seemingly populated correctly.

  - There's no way to edit/refine a search.

- Transfer

  - Top 5 fields and don't expand width-wise.

  - Bottom 2 fields [Currency Transfer] don't expand width-wise.

- View Lots

  - Dialog opens too small [whole bottom panel is invisible]

  - Weird toolbar/menubar/action-list thingy at top.

  - [HIG] no "ok/cancel" buttons in dialog.

- Business Functions

  - Everything works but the New Invoice/Bill code.  The dialog seems to
    function properly but then gnucash crashed when the dialog is closed.

  - The dialog-invoice.c needs to switch over to using GtkActions /
    menu-merging so that it can call `gnc_extensions_menu_setup ( GtkWindow,
    char*, EggMenuMerge)`

- Reporting [somewhat functional]

  - Graphing still unsupported; [jsled] in periodic contact with Jody
    Goldberg of Gnumeric regarding Gnome Office Graphing [GOG] to be factored
    out of gnumeric into libgoffice.
    GOG integrated but not completely working - warlord - 2005-04-23.

  - Save/restore in unknown state; believed to crash on re-start.

  - First report sets report name text for tab but no other report can change it.

- Importing

  - HBCI - Needs new HTTP support [gnet] -- huh, no, the
    import-export/hbci module does not need any extra http library,
    especially not at compile-time. The module only needs the
    aqbanking library but really nothing else. If the aqbanking
    library links against any http library, then that's a business of
    that library, but to my knowledge it comes with its own http
    implementation so gnucash should really not be concerned about
    http! cstim, 2005-04-09.

- Budgeting

  - Can create/modify budgets via the Budgeting workbench. (Actions->Budgeting Workbench)

  - Track budget tab still needs to be completed.  Should allow you to look
    at predicted vs. actual information.

  - No save to file functionality.  Therefore budgets must currently be
    created fresh each time gnucash is started.  First thing what I want to fix.

  - Should the budgeting workbench fit into the new windowing scheme better?
    Currently it is its own window but maybe each workbench should be a tab
    in the new layout.  How would this work with the sub-tabs?  Have to think
    about this some more.

  - Probably more TODO but these are the main points.

- Preferences

  - Business

    - Business -> Accumulate splits on Post?  option not present.  Not sure if
      this is intentionally missing. PJK [ tested after g2 merge of 30 Dec 04?
      -derek ]

  - Account Tree Options

    - dialog doesn't expand/fill on resize

    - changing displayed columns has strange effects (some columns being
      added, some not, some seeming off-by-one errors, &c.)

  - Stylesheets

    - Dialog opens with inappropriate scrollbars.

- Hierarchy Merge - BROKEN

  - Doesn't let you complete the conflict resolution process, thus you can never complete the druid.

========================================
              ENHANCEMENTS
========================================

- New icons

  - Add account.

  - Register

  - Report

    - "Report options", especially, since it often confuses users.

- Preferences

  - Support a preference on whether new plugin pages appear in the same or a
    new window.

     - We definitely want register windows to appear in new top-levels.

     - Reporting windows should probably appear in the top-level they were
       created from.

- In-place editing

  - Provide in-place editing where feasable.  Eg.  Editing the account code
    or the account name, but not being able to re-parent the account.  (Maybe
    add DND support for this in long-term?)

- Print Preview

  - Needed

- File Menu

  - Rename "New Account Tree" to "Display Account Tree" as "New" gives the
    impression that a creation of something will occur.  PJK

# some manual cleanup of the results results in the list here:
error_info_free
error_info_print
 - provided by error-info.[hc]
font_selector_get_pango
font_selector_get_type
font_selector_new
font_selector_set_from_pango
 - used by gog-style.c:gog_style_editor.
 - gog_styled_object_editor, however, is called from gog-{axis,label,legend,series}.
format_value
 - seems straightforward, but depends on format logic.
gnm_app_display_dpi_get
 - thin wrapper over configuration; should be easy to stub out.
gnm_app_get_pixbuf
 - called by go_action_combo_color_new, which isn't called in lib...
gnm_font_find_closest_from_weight_slant
 - depends on gnome print, but nicely seperable.
gnm_measure_string
 - nicely seperable; depends on pango.
gnm_pixbuf_intelligent_scale
 - nicely seperable; depends on GdkPixbuf.
gnm_plugin_get_dir_name
gnm_plugin_use_ref
gnm_plugin_use_unref
 - split/plugin.[hc]; seems to wrap plugin_* stuff...
gnm_setup_label_atk
 - seperable
gnm_widget_disable_focus
 - seperable
gnumeric_button_new_with_stock_image
 - looks seperable [being stolen from gtkedit]
gnumeric_load_pixbuf
 - depends weakly on gnumeric configuration path.
go_nan
 - text symbol
gui_image_file_select
 - used to select [fill] image file by gog-style ... do we need the UI
   elements of gog-style here?
