/** @addtogroup Backend

    The QOF Backend is a pseudo-object providing an interface between the
    engine and a persistant data store (e.g. a server, a database, or
    a file).   Backends are not meant to be used directly by an
    application; instead the Session should be used to make a
    connection with some particular backend.
    There are no backend functions that are 'public' to
    users of the engine.  The backend can, however, report errors to
    the GUI & other front-end users.  This file defines these errors.

    Backends are used to save and restore Entities in a Book.
