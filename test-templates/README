Unit Test Templates

This directory contains three template files for setting up GLib
g_test operated unit tests in a test directory. If your module
directory doesn't already have one, create a test subdirectory and add
it to configure.ac.

If there is already a test directory with make check tests in it, copy
the contents of the Makefile.am in this directory to the existing
Makefile.am; otherwise, copy the Makefile.am to your test directory.

There are two groups of templates here: testmain.c is for a standalone test
program that doesn't group tests into suites. test-module.c and test-suite.c
support collecting a large number of tests separated in suites into a single
test program. In most cases you'll want to use the latter.

For a single file test program, copy testmain.c into your test directory,
renaming it appropriately. Write fixtures and test functions as needed and
register them in main(). Create a target in Makefile.am which has this file as
its source.

To use suites, copy test-module.c and test-suite.c to your test directory and
rename them appropriately. You will very likely want several copies of
test-suite.c, one corresponding to each c file in the module directory that
you're testing.

Edit the test module file to call the (renamed) test_suite_module() in
each test-suite file. Add tests and fixtures as needed to the
test-suite files and register them in the (renamed) test_suite_module()
function.

Alternatively you can use the make_testfile perl program in this directory to
create a skeleton test-suite file for your target file. In addition to creating
a template test function for each function in the target source file and a
template test-suite function at the end, it will comment each template function
with the usage of that function both internally and externally. Run `perldoc
make_testfile` to read more.

Edit Makefile.am according to the comments in the file.

Run autogen.sh and configure. "make check" will run all tests; "make test" will
run only the GLib unit tests not guarded by conditionals (see test-suite.c). For
more control, use gtester as documented in the GLib docs.

There are some helpful macros and message-trapping functions in
src/test-core/unittest-support.h, whose Doxygen documentation is at
