/** @addtogroup Lot Lots: Core Function for AR/AP, Inventory, Stock Lots, Cap Gains
 * One often needs to know that the item 'bought' in one transaction
 * is the same one as the item 'sold' in a different transaction.
 * Lots are used to make this association.  One Lot holds all of the
 * splits that involve the same item.   A lot is typically formed when
 * the item is bought, and is closed when the item is sold out.
 * A lot need not be a single item, it can be a quantity of the same
 * thing e.g. 500 gallons of paint (sold off a few gallons at a time).
 *
 * Lots are required to correctly implement invoices, inventory,
 * depreciation and stock market investment gains. See the file
 * src/doc/lots.txt for a detailed implementation overview.
 *
 * A lot is "closed" when the number of items in the lot has gone to zero.
 * It is very easy to compute the gains/losses for a closed lot: it is the
 * sum-total of the values of the items put into/taken out of the lot.
 * (Realized) Gains on still-open lots can be computed by pro-rating the
 * purchase prices.
 *
 * Lots are nothing more than a collection or grouping of splits in an
 * account. All of the splits in a lot must belong to the same account;
 * there's no mix-n-match.  Thus, in this sense, a lot belongs to an
 * account as well.
 *
 * Lots have an implicit "opening date": the date of the earliest split in
 * the lot. The "close date" is the date of the split that brought the lot
 * item balance down to zero.
