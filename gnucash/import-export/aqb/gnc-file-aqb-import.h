 * This routine will pop up a standard file selection dialog asking the user to

 *
 * @param aqbanking_importername The aqbanking importer module that should be
 * used.  Possible values: "dtaus", "csv", "swift", or more.
 *
 * @param aqbanking_formatname In aqbanking, each importer has one or more data
 * formats available which define the actual data fields that should be used.
 * In aqbanking, such a different format is called a "profile".  Possible values
 * for swift: "swift-mt940" or "swift-mt942", but for all others: "default", or
 * more precisely: Look into $datadir/aqbanking/imexporters and look into the
 * "name" field of the foo.conf files.
 *
 * @param exec_as_aqbanking_jobs If TRUE, additionally queue the imported
 * transactions as online jobs over aqbanking/HBCI.  If FALSE, just import the
 * transactions and that's it.
