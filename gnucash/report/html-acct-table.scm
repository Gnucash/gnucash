;; DESCRIPTION
;; 
;; The html-acct-table object is a utility object, not an html object.
;; It is used to collect and then render a table whose leftmost column(s)
;; are a list or chart of accounts.
;; 
;; You start by creating the object and initializing it with a list of
;; accounts and a few assorted parameters.  It generates a table, which
;; can be read using accessor functions, containing information which
;; makes it easy(ier) to create a great variety of html-table forms.
;; 
;;               add-accounts            add-account-balances
;;  account-list ------------> html-acct-table ----------> html-table
;;
;;    Figure Key:
;;
;;       account-list: a list of accounts as would be returned from
;;       looking up the value of a report option added with
;;       gnc:options-add-account-selection!
;;
;;       add-accounts: any method that adds the account list to the
;;       html-acct-table.  For example, this could be accomplished
;;       with gnc:make-html-acct-table/env/acct or
;;       gnc:html-acct-table-add-accounts!
;;
;;       html-acct-table: the utility object described in this file
;;
;;       add-account-balances: any function that maps the internal
;;       data of the html-acct-table object into a html-table.  For
;;       example, one such function is
;;       gnc:html-table-add-account-balances.
;;
;;       html-table: an <html-table> scheme object representing an
;;       HTML table block.  See html-table.scm.
;;
;; This utility object was written because of some shortcomings
;; inherent in how the gnc:html-build-acct-table function was
;; designed.  Ultimately, the intent is to replace
;; gnc:html-build-acct-table with an html-acct-table with the
;; appropriate thunks.  But, because this is new, I'm leaving the
;; original gnc:html-build-acct-table in place, just to be safe.
;;
;;
;; ARGUMENTS
;; 
;; For boolean arguments, #t and #f have their usual meanings.  If a
;; boolean argument is not set, a default value may be assumed.  For
;; non-boolean arguments, values may be specified.  When #f is
;; specified as the value of a non-boolean argument, it generally
;; means to omit whatever function the argument controls.  When #t is
;; specified for such an argument, it generally means to use that
;; functionality, but just accept whatever default functionality that
;; option may have.
;; 
;; The list of accounts which are to be placed in the
;; gnc:html-acct-table object can be controlled with the
;; gnc:make-html-acct-table/accts, gnc:make-html-acct-table/env/accts,
;; and gnc:html-table-add-accts!  functions.  But you should only use
;; one of these methods to add accounts.
;; 
;; The gnc:html-acct-table parameters should be set BEFORE adding the
;; account list.  They can be set with gnc:make-html-acct-table/env
;; or gnc:make-html-acct-table/accts/env and fetched with
;; gnc:html-acct-table-env; accept the following parameters:
;; 
;;     display-tree-depth: integer 'unlimited ['all] #f
;; 
;;         the number of levels of accounts to display
;;         'unlimited, 'all, and #f impose no depth limit.
;;         the default is 'all.  [CAS: ISTM, the default is actually #f,
;;         and this case bombs at (< logi-depth depth-limit) anytime the
;;         limit behavior is not 'flatten.  BUG?   Also, setting this
;;         parameter to a large integer value has the strange side-effect
;;         of pushing the balances column far right, even when the account
;;         tree is relatively shallow.]
;; 
;;     depth-limit-behavior: ['summarize] 'flatten 'truncate
;; 
;;         when the display tree reaches its depth limit, this option
;;         tells gnc:html-acct-table what to do.  'summarize tells it
;;         to omit accounts below the depth limit and summarize their
;;         contents as belonging to their parent account at the depth
;;         limit. 'flatten tells it to display every selected
;;         subaccount, all the way down the tree, but to position
;;         them, in the chart, at the depth limit. the default value
;;         is 'summarize
;; 
;;     initial-indent: integer
;; 
;;         the number of table cells to indent the first level of
;;         accounts displayed. this is merely a convenience.  the
;;         default initial-indent is 0.
;; 
;;     account-less-p: binary_predicate #t #f
;; 
;;         used for sorting accounts, below each parent account, into
;;         the order in which they will be displayed.  the function
;;         must take two Account arguments and represent a total
;;         ordering on Account-space.  #t means to use the default
;;         sorting function.  #f means to preform no sorting.  the
;;         default sorting function is gnc:account-code-less-p.
;; 
;;     start-date: time64
;; 
;;         the starting date of the reporting period over which to
;;         report balances for this account.  if start-date is #f,
;;         will be no limit on how early a counted transaction may
;;         ocurr.
;; 
;;     end-date: time64
;; 
;;         the ending date of the reporting period over which to
;;         report balances for this account.  if end-date is #f, there
;;         will be no limit on how late a counted transaction may
;;         ocurr. note: i do not know if GnuCash, right now, supports
;;         transactions in the future. so be prepared for the
;;         possibility that this may match transactions which haven't
;;         ocurred, yet. [CAS: I don't think end-date of #f works.
;;         It bombs.]
;; 
;;     report-commodity: commodity
;; 
;;         the commodity into which to convert any balances containing
;;         foreign currencies.  the balance will be converted using
;;         the exchange function exchange-fn. the default is the
;;         currency returned by (gnc-default-report-currency).  [CAS:
;;         what if I don't want the report to have a
;;         "report-commodity"?  Say e.g. I want to show each account
;;         balance in its native commodity?  I can see the benefit of
;;         individual reports that have a report-commodity using
;;         gnc-default-report-currency to set the default value for a
;;         report-commodity option.  But, with the default sucked in
;;         here, in what is supposed to be a more general api, means
;;         reports can't specify NO report-commodity. ]
;;
;; CAS: Hypothetical design modification: Instead of specifying a
;; single report commodity and exchange-fn for the whole acct-table,
;; what if we were allowed to specify a *price-source* and an
;; *optional* report-commodity.  Then, if the no report commodity is
;; specified, then we can generate the exchange-fn on a per-account
;; basis, using gnc:case-exchange-fn and the account's native
;; commodity and the given price-source.  Otherwise (i.e. if there IS
;; a report-commodity specified), we can use *that* commodity for each
;; account's exchange-fn.
;;
;;     exchange-fn: commodity_exchange_function
;; 
;;         the commodity exchange function (you know, that weighted
;;         average, most recent, nearest in time fun stuff) used to
;;         convert balances which are not exclusively in the report
;;         commodity into the report commodity.  [CAS: Right now,
;;         exchange-fn is not optional.  If your accounts have
;;         different commodities and you don't specify a valid
;;         exchange function then simply adding the accounts to the
;;         html-acct-table object will crash, even if you never want
;;         to display any values at all.  This is bad.  UPDATE: As a
;;         short-term fix, I've made this parameter optional.  If no
;;         exchange-fn is given, you can at least add the accounts to
;;         the html-acct-table object without crashing.  Just don't
;;         count on meaningful report-comm-{account|recursive}-bal
;;         values (they'll also be #f).]
;;
;;     column-header: html-table-header-cell #f #t
;; 
;;          the table column header cell (TH tag) with which to head
;;          the columns containing the account tree.  if supplied, the
;;          header cell may contain style information.  if #f, no
;;          column header cell will be used.  if #t, a default header
;;          cell (reading "Account") will be used.  the colspan of any
;;          header cell will be automatically set appropriately. this
;;          is for convenience only; gnc:html-acct-table does not use
;;          this data.
;; 
;;     account-label-mode: 'name 'anchor
;; 
;;          tells whether to render account labels as hyperlinks or
;;          text.  stylesheets, really, should be able to remove
;;          link markup.
;; 
;;     parent-account-subtotal-mode: #t #f 'canonically-tabbed
;; 
;;          indicates whether or not to add a line, recursively
;;          subtotalling an account and its descendents, for any
;;          account with children (non-leaf account).  if #t or
;;          #canonically-tabbed, a subtotal row will be created for
;;          each non-leaf account.  if #f, no non-leaf account
;;          subtotal rows will be created.  if 'canonically-tabbed,
;;          account total entry labels will be placed at the position
;;          specified by accounting texts (indented one column from
;;          the accounts being totalled, two columns from where
;;          gnc:html-acct-table would otherwise place them). the
;;          default is #f.
;; 
;;     zero-balance-mode: 'show-leaf-acct 'omit-leaf-acct
;; 
;;          indicates what to do with accounts with zero balance. if
;;          'omit-leaf-acct, no account row will be generated for any
;;          account having a balance of zero. otherwise, a row will be
;;          generated for the account.
;; 
;;     balance-mode: 'pre-adjusting 'pre-closing 'post-closing
;;
;;          indicates whether or not to ignore adjusting/closing
;;          entries when computing account balances. 'pre-closing
;;          ignores only closing entries. 'pre-adjusting also ignores
;;          adjusting entries. 'post-closing counts all entries.
;; 
;;     adjusting-pattern: alist of 'str 'cased 'regexp
;; 
;;          a pattern alist, as accepted by
;;          gnc:account-get-trans-type-balance-interval, matching
;;          adjusting transactions to be ignored when balance-mode is
;;          'pre-adjusting.
;; 
;;     closing-pattern: alist of 'str 'cased 'regexp
;; 
;;          a pattern alist, as accepted by
;;          gnc:account-get-trans-type-balance-interval, matching
;;          closing transactions to be ignored when balance-mode is
;;          'pre-closing.

;; 
;;     account-path: string
;; 
;;         the full name of the account in the current row. i.e., if

;;         the value will be "Assets:Current Assets:Cash".
;; 
;;     account-name: string
;; 
;;         the "basename" of the account in the current row. i.e., if
;;         the name of the account is "Assets:Current Assets:Cash",
;;         the value will be "Cash".
;; 
;;     account-code: string
;;

;; 
;;     logical-depth: integer
;; 
;;         the depth at which the account in the current row resides
;;         in the effective account tree.  this is the depth the

;;         note that this may differ from account-depth when a
;;         selected account has an unselected ancestor.

;;         unlike in gnc:html-build-acct-table, the first level of
;;         accounts is level 0. this means that display-depth is also
;;         the number of empty cells which should preced the account
;;         name in the gnc:html-table being generated.
;; 
;;     indented-depth: integer
;; 
;;         the depth at which the account in the current row resides

;;         indent.  CAS: I think *display-depth* plus indent would
;;         make more sense.  Then it's like an absolute column index.
;; 
;;     logical-cols: integer
;; 
;;         the number of columns in which account labels were placed.
;; 
;;     label-cols: integer
;; 
;;         the number of columns in the group of account columns to

;; 
;;     account-cols: integer
;; 
;;         the number of columns in the group of account columns.  if

;;
;;     report-comm-account-bal: commodity-collector
;; 
;;         the balance of the account in the current row, exclusive of

;; 
;; DIFFERENCES FROM PARAMETERS USED BY gnc:html-build-acct-table
;; 
;; The show-subaccounts? option of gnc:html-build-acct-table, which
;; used to select an accounts recursively like the "-R" option to ls,
;; has been removed.  I find it both confusing, as a user, and
;; obfuscating, as a programmer.  Any accounts which are to be
;; included in the report may be selected in the Accounts options
;; widget.  While, when selecting whole subtrees of accounts, this may
;; be tedious, this really is a GUI problem.  The ideal solution would
;; be to give the Account selection widget a "recursively select"
;; option which selects (i.e., highlights) both the account selected and
;; all its subaccounts.  Note that, as a worst-case workaround, the
;; user could always use the spacebar and arrow keys to select entire
;; subtrees rather rapidly.  It order to make this shortcoming as
;; benign as possible, reports are advised to make the default account
;; selection that which is closest to what the report user is likely
;; to select.  It is my hope that a recursive account selection widget
;; will soon be implemented.
;; 
;; The group-types? option of gnc:html-build-acct-table, which
;; would display accounts by account type and supply header and
;; total lines for each type (see source), has been removed.
;; It is easy enough to duplicate this functionality, report-side,
;; using the new gnc:html-acct-table object.
;;
;; The start-percent and delta-percent options of
;; gnc:html-build-acct-table, which told the function to
;; gnc:report-percent-done start-percent to
;; (start-percent+start-delta) percent of the progress bar, has been
;; removed.  Most of the report building is done while reading the
;; gnc:html-acct-table object, anyway, so this is not a great loss.
;; This functionality should, however, be included as the amount of
;; work required to build an gnc:html-acct-table object is
;; non-trivial.  Being non-critical as it is, this is left as a future
;; project.  Since much of the code for this has already been written
;; (in gnc:html-build-acct-table), when the time comes, this
;; functionality should not be difficult to add.
;; 
;; 
;; INTERNALS
;; 
;; Internally, html-acct-table uses an html-table object to store
;; data.  Since the html-acct-table object is arguably a more general
;; class than html-table, one might think that the html-table object
;; should be written to use an html-acct-table for data storage,
;; manipulation, and access.  The html-table class, as it happens, was
;; written first, so the decision was made to use it rather than
;; redesign the horse around the carriage.
;; 
;; It may also be possible to have made html-acct-table a markup/style
;; sheet pair.  To do this, the html-acct-table (which would
;; essentially be a markup object) would have to store thunks and call
;; them when rendering its contents to its parent html-doc.  This
;; means that report code would be called during stylization, rather
;; than while building the report.  Making html-acct-table a utility
;; object means that one can use it in a report generator in a
;; programmatic manner, keeping clear the separation between report
;; generation and stylization.
;; 
;; The first cell in each row of the html-table consist of an a-list
;; of row-parameters.  These parameters are described in PARAMETERS
;; above.  Any remaining cells in the row represent data set by the
;; user.  This class simply maps its contents to the html-table.
;;
