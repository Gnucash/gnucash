	* [r18538] doc/tip_of_the_day.list.in: Bug #605414: Clarify
	  Quick-fill tip of the day Patch by James Raehl: Patch adds Tab

	* [r18537] src/gnome/glade/sched-xact.glade: Bug #605415: Relax
	  limit on scheduled days in the future Patch by James Raehl:
	  Expand scheduled transaction date limit by 366 days Usually,
	  scheduled transactions are limited to 365 days in the future.
	  This patch doubles that limit plus adds a day for leap years.
	  The patch supports a method for separating transactions that are
	  not yet posted at the bank, by assigning an initial date one
	  year in the future. Under this method, scheduled transactions
	  and their reminders are one year in the future, since they have
	  not happened yet.

	  Implement currency trading accounts optionally, to be enabled
	  per-book. Patch by Mike Alexander: This patch implements trading
	  accounts somewhat as described in Peter Selinger's document at
	  <http://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/accounting/gnucash.html>.
	  Although he describes it as a multiple currency problem, it
	  really applies to any transactions involving multiple
	  commodities (for example buying or selling a stock) Hence I've
	  called the trading accounts "commodity exchange accounts" which
	  seems more descriptive. In summary these patches add an option
	  to use commodity exchange accounts and if it is on a transaction
	  must be balanced both in value (in the transaction currency) and
	  in each commodity or currency used in any split in the
	  transaction. If a transaction only contains splits in the
	  transaction currency then this is the same rule as Gnucash has
	  always enforced. In this patch, the option to use trading
	  accounts has been moved from Edit->Preferences to
	  File->Properties and is now associated with the active book
	  instead of being a global option. If you have set the global
	  value on in a previous version you will need to set it on again
	  in each file for which you want trading accounts, the previous
	  global setting will be ignored. A more detailed list of changes
	  follows: 1. Added a "Use commodity exchange accounts" per-book
	  option. 2. Added gnc_monetary and MonetaryList data types. 3.
	  Renamed xaccTransGetImbalance to xaccTransGetImbalanceValue and
	  added a new xaccTransGetImbalance that returns a MonetaryList.
	  Also added xaccTransIsBalanced to see if the transaction is
	  balanced without returning a GList that needs to be freed. It
	  calls both xaccTransGetImbalance and xaccTransGetImbalanceValue
	  since a transaction may be unbalanced with regard to either
	  without being unbalanced with regard to the other. 4. Changed
	  gnc_split_register_get_debcred_bg_color to use
	  xaccTransIsBalanced. 5. Changed gnc_split_register_balance_trans
	  to not offer to adjust an existing split if there imbalances in
	  multiple currencies. Because of bugs in the register code this
	  is rarely called. 6. Changed importers to use
	  xaccTransGetImbalanceValue to check for imbalance, assuming that
	  they won't create multiple currency transactions. 7. Changed
	  xaccTransScrubImbalance to create a balancing split for each
	  imbalanced commodity in the transaction. Also balances the
	  transaction value. The commodity balancing splits go into
	  accounts in the hierarchy Trading:NAMESPACE:COMMODITY. The value
	  balancing splits go into Imbalance-CURRENCY as before. 8.
	  Changed xaccSplitConvertAmount to use xaccTransIsBalanced
	  instead of xaccTransGetImbalance. 9. Changed
	  gnc_split_register_get_debcred_entry to sometimes use the split
	  amount instead of value if using currency accounts. If the
	  register is a stock register (i.e., shows shares and prices), it
	  uses the value if the split is in the register commodity (i.e.
	  is for the stock) and the amount otherwise. It shows the
	  currency symbol unless the commodity is the default currency. If
	  the register is not a stock register it always uses the amount
	  and shows the currency symbol if the split is not in the
	  register commodity. Also changed it to not return a value for a
	  null split unless the transaction is unbalanced in exactly one
	  currency. This is what goes in a blank split as the proposed
	  value. 10. Changed refresh_model_row to use
	  xaccTransGetImbalanceValue to get the imbalance, assuming that
	  importers don't create transactions in multiple currencies. Also
	  same change in gnc_import_process_trans_item,
	  downloaded_transaction_append, and
	  gnc_import_TransInfo_is_balanced. 11. Changed the
	  TRANS_IMBALANCE accessor method in xaccTransRegister to use
	  xaccTransGetImbalanceValue. As far as I can tell this is only
	  used by the "pd-balance" query type in
	  gnc_scm2query_term_query_v1() defined in engine-helpers.c. This
	  query type only tests the result for zero/non-zero. 12. Changed
	  xaccTransGetAccountConvRate to accept any split into the correct
	  commodity instead of insisting on one into the provided account.
	  Then can use it in xaccTransScrubImbalance to set the value of
	  the imbalance split from its amount, however later changed
	  xaccTransScrubImbalance to not use it. Instead it sets the value
	  for the new split correctly to keep the value of the whole
	  transaction balanced. 13. Changed the balance sheet report to
	  include a new option to not compute unrealized gains and losses.
	  14. Related to 9 above, changed gnc_split_register_auto_calc to
	  not do anything if given a stock register where the value cell
	  doesn't contain the value. 15. Also related to 9, changed
	  gnc_split_register_save_amount_values to set the amount and
	  value fields in the split correctly when using trading accounts.
	  16. Changed the new account and edit account dialogs to allow
	  any commodity or currency for an income account if using trading
	  accounts. It would be better to add a new account type for
	  trading accounts, but that's a big deal and I'll leave that for
	  later after we see whether this set of changes is going to be
	  accepted or rejected. 17. Change
	  gnc_xfer_dialog_run_exchange_dialog to understand that the new
	  value is really the split's amount if using trading accounts.
	  18. Changed xaccSplitGetOtherSplit to ignore trading splits if
	  using commodity exchange accounts.

	  Patch by James Raehl: Currently, the only editable date in the

	  second editable date in the first field of the second line of a
	  double-line mode register. The entry date is borrowed in this
	  implementation. I understand the entry date is used for such as
	  stock transactions, but to me is mostly useless for those
	  keeping track of personal finances. This feature has been
	  requested on occasion, such as at
	  https://lists.gnucash.org/pipermail/gnucash-devel/2003-August/010279.html
	  and https://bugs.gnucash.org/show_bug.cgi?id=92274 and
	  http://lists.gnucash.org/pipermail/gnucash-user/2009-October/031839.html
	  "Transaction date" refers to such as the date the purchase was
	  rung up in the store cash register, payment mailed or possibly
	  received by the recipient, payment received by you, date you
	  walked into the bank to make a deposit, or even the date the
	  expense was scheduled. Your intent to expend the money is
	  definitely determined. "Bank posting date" is when the bank has
	  finally debited or credited your account. "Date entered" in
	  Gnucash would be identical to "transaction date", if you always

	  posts the payment, and date the bank debits the payment. I track
	  even more dates on credit card transactions: statement date,
	  date bill received, payment mailing date, card payment received
	  (card transaction) date, card posting date, and bank posting
	  date. These are currently entered into my transaction Notes
	  field, which is one reason for my multi-line up/down Notes field
	  scroll patch, but Notes dates are not sortable. Obviously, the
	  use of sortable dates is flexible. I use one date as a budget
	  date (group budgeted expenses with paychecks), and the second as
	  bank posting date. I could obviously use a third date, the
	  "transaction date", but haven't implemented that yet (much more
	  work).

	  Bug #554394: Income Tax Enhancements Patch by J. Alex Aycinena.
	  Patch does the following: - update the tax information in
	  'txf.scm', which is based on V037 of the TXF Spec, to V041, the
	  last version issued (bug #554394) - provide support for multiple
	  copies of certain tax Forms/Schedules (e.g., Schedule C(1),
	  Schedule C(2), etc.) - support multiple types of tax entities:
	  partnerships, corporations and S corporations, in addition to
	  individual tax payers - support balance sheet accounts, required
	  for these new tax entity types - add the term 'Income' in
	  several places to avoid confusion with sales or VAT style taxes
	  in the business features (e.g., change the menu from 'Tax
	  Options' to 'Income Tax Options') The following files were
	  changed, as follows, to implement these changes: 1.
	  src/engine/Account.c and 2. src/engine/Account.h: add copy
	  number capability (define 'xaccAccountGetTaxUSCopyNumber' and
	  'xaccAccountSetTaxUSCopyNumber'); modify
	  'xaccAccountSetTaxUSCode' to remove KVP when no tax-code
	  assigned, clean up tax-source descriptions 3.

	  'Income Tax Options' 4. src/app-utils/gnc-ui-util.c and 5.
	  src/app-utils/gnc-ui-util.h: add setter and getter functions for
	  book tax name and book tax type which are stored in a book KVP,
	  show copy information in accounts page, tax column, show error
	  messages for various conditions 6. src/app-utils/app-utils.i:

	  src/tax/us/txf.scm: update to V041 for individuals, add V041
	  support for multiple additional tax entity types and balance
	  sheet accounts and related tax codes, add tax form line data 10.

	  string Patch by Mike Alexander (plus documentation comment by
	  me): Neither gnc:make-complex-boolean-option nor
	  gnc:make-simple-boolean-option (which calls it) correctly stores
	  its result in the KVP that it is using. This is because it calls
	  kvp-frame-get-slot-path-gslist and
	  kvp-frame-set-slot-path-gslist to get and set the value. Both of
	  these are implemented in C and the code in kvp-scm.c can't
	  convert a Scheme boolean value to or from a KvpValue since there
	  is no boolean type in KvpValue. There are already a few places
	  that have comments suggesting that there should be a
	  KVP_TYPE_BOOLEAN type, but adding this would be non-trivial. For
	  now I'll supply a patch that will store the boolean value as a
	  string (which is what code in xaccAccountSetAutoInterestXfer in
	  Account.c does).

	  Improve original register running balance implementation. Patch
	  by Tim M: The attached patch is an enhancement to the original
	  reg_run_balance patch that was implemented. This patch has been
	  created off of a recent trunk (in the last week). It makes the
	  following changes: 1. Add a gboolean to the argument list of the
	  gnc_split_register_get_rbaln() function. If the new boolean
	  value is set to TRUE, then the function will return the running
	  balance for the parent account and all subaccounts. If set to
	  FALSE, the function will only return the running balance of the
	  parent account and will not include the subaccounts. The
	  function has been modified also to accommodate this change. 2.
	  Update existing calls to the function to add the boolean value.
	  This patch does not actually implement a runtime balance for
	  single account register view or normal balance column because of
	  potential issues that will need to be addressed, but it opens up
	  the possibility for easy implementation of such a change.

	* [r18352] src/report/standard-reports/standard-reports.scm: Bug
	  #593906: Fix crash at creating account report Patch by Mike
	  Alexander: I tracked it down to the set of changes made in
	  r18253 to automatically load all the reports in the
	  standard-reports directory. This changed standard-reports.scm to
	  use resolve-module instead of use-modules to load reports. One
	  difference between these two is that resolve-module doesn't make
	  the interface for the loaded module available to the module
	  containing the call to resolve-module. This causes a crash when
	  gnc:register-report-create in standard-reports.scm tries to call
	  gnc:register-report-create-internal which is located in
	  register.scm (one of the modules loaded using resolve-module). I
	  fixed it by explicitly defining that interface using the "@"
	  guile function after the modules are loaded. You could also
	  probably just add back a call to use-module for that module, but
	  this seems to work and makes it explicit what interface is
	  needed. Signed-off-by: Christian Stimming <stimming@tuhh.de>

	  registers Bug 585784 - Wrong fractional precision displayed in
	  stock/mutual fund registers The original patch attempted to fix
	  bug #529494 by replacing the gnc_split_value_print_info function
	  with gnc_split_register_print_info, which instead of using the
	  print info of the transaction's commodity, used the print info
	  of the commodity of the register's account. However, this was
	  not the correct behavior in all cases either. This patch
	  eliminates the gnc_split_register_print_info and instead puts
	  the logic for selecting the appropriate print info into the
	  functions which previously called it. * In
	  gnc_split_register_get_balance_entry, the print info of the
	  account of the split is used (xaccSplitGetAccount); if the split
	  doesn't have an account, the print info of the register's
	  default account (gnc_split_register_get_default_account) is used
	  * In gnc_split_register_get_debcred_entry, if there is no split,
	  the account info of the register's default account
	  (gnc_split_register_get_default_account) is used. Otherwise, if
	  the register is a Stock/Mutual Fund register or an (obsolete)
	  Currency register, the print info of the transaction's currency
	  is used (xaccTransGetCurrency). Finally in all other cases, the
	  print info of the register's default account
	  (gnc_split_register_get_default_account) is used. * In
	  gnc_template_register_get_debcred_entry, there is no account to
	  reference, so the default print info (gnc_default_print_info) is
	  used. Patch by Daniel Harding.

	  vs. unsigned char pointer type conflicts. This patch contains
	  those cases where a cast was unavoidable. Patch by J. Alex
	  Aycinena. Detailed explanation follows: 1 -
	  src/register/register-gnome/gnucash-item-edit.c The variable
	  'sel' is set with 'gtk_selection_data_get_text' which returns a
	  'guchar *'; 'sel' is then used by functions
	  'gtk_editable_insert_text' and 'strlen' which require 'gchar *',
	  so there is no alternative but to cast. 2 -
	  src/backend/xml/gnc-budget-xml-v2.c The functions
	  'xmlNewNode' and 'xmlSetProp' require arguments that are of type
	  'const xmlChar *' but the arguments are string literals (char
	  *). Can string literals be set up as type 'const xmlChar *'? The
	  patchfile has them being cast. BAD_CAST is defined for this
	  purpose. 3 - src/backend/xml/gnc-schedxaction-xml-v2.c Like
	  above, the function 'xmlNewNode' requires arguments that are of
	  type 'const xmlChar *' but the arguments are string literals
	  (char *). In the three other changes the type 'const xmlChar *'
	  needs to be changed to 'char *' to be used by 'strcmp'. 4 -
	  src/backend/xml/gnc-recurrence-xml-v2.c Like above for the
	  functions 'xmlNewNode' and 'xmlSetProp'. 5 -
	  src/html/gnc-html-graph-gog-webkit.c The function
	  'g_base64_encode' requires type 'guchar *' for the argument and
	  changing the variable to this caused other problems so used
	  casting instead. 6 - src/libqof/backend/file/qsf-xml-map.c (6
	  occurrences) The first occurrence was solved by changing the type
	  declaration, but the other 5 required casting.

	  This patch fixes part of the problem for AqBanking 4.x (or

	  older AqBanking versions should be added. Patch by Micha Lenk,

	  src/report/report-system/report-system.scm,
	  src/report/report-system/report-utilities.scm: Reports: Speed up
	  the report infrastructure. Patch by Mike Alexander. One set of
	  changes speeds up the three functions in report-utilities.scm:
	  gnc:account-get-comm-balance-interval
	  gnc:accountlist-get-comm-balance-interval
	  gnc:accountlist-get-comm-balance-at-date These can all be
	  implemented as calls to
	  gnc:account-get-trans-type-balance-interval (with a minor change
	  to it to ignore the type parameter if it is #f) and it is much
	  faster since it does a single query instead of a loop over an
	  account list. The other set of changes is in
	  gnc:html-acct-table-add-accounts! in html-acct-table.scm. This
	  functions starts off by building a hash table of account
	  balances it cares about. The code to do this did a recursive
	  loop over the relevant accounts. I changed it to do a query to
	  find the splits in the accounts it cares about and build the
	  hash table from them. This speeds it up by a couple of orders of
	  magnitude.

	  that matches the same transaction. Because each transaction can

	* [r17868] src/backend/file/io-gncxml-v2.c: Bug #569735: Don't
	  create a new nested template root account when a file is opened
	  Whenever an XML file is opened, Gnucash creates a new template
	  root account and makes the old one a child of it. My main
	  accounts file had them nested over 540 deep before I got annoyed
	  enough to fix this. The problem is that sxtg_book_begin creates
	  a root account when the book is opened. Then
	  add_template_transaction_local tries to replace this new root
	  account with the one read from the file. However the code that
	  does this is rather badly broken and the result is that the one
	  read from the file becomes a child of the one created in
	  sxtg_book_begin. This patch avoids creating any more nested root
	  accounts, but it doesn't get rid of the ones that are already
	  there. This is slightly more tricky than just deleting them
	  since, although most of them have no children (other than the
	  next root account), some do. Accounts created for template
	  transactions will be children of whatever root account happens
	  to be at the top of the tree then. As the file is saved and
	  reopened, this will get pushed down into the tree of accounts.
	  In my case about 5 of the 540 or so root accounts had other
	  children. Patch by Mike Alexander. BP

	  #435642: Fix crash when editing results of a find I finally got
	  around to looking into this some more. I think the problem is a
	  result of an interaction between gnc_split_register_redraw and
	  gnc_split_register_find_split when called from
	  gnc_split_register_move_cursor in split-register-control.c. As
	  the comment says, "redrawing the register can muck everything
	  up". In particular calling gnc_split_register_redraw may change
	  the "transaction split" for some or all of the transactions if
	  the register is a "ledger" style register such as the one for
	  find results. This causes the subsequent call to
	  gnc_split_register_find_split to find the wrong register row if
	  the cursor class being found is CURSOR_CLASS_TRANS. Whether this
	  causes a crash seems to depend on circumstances I haven't quite
	  figured out, but I have one test file that crashes 100% of the
	  time in r17804. This patch changes the way
	  gnc_split_register_find_split works when asked to find the
	  transaction split for a transaction. It assumes that any
	  transaction can only have one such split and returns as soon as
	  it finds a row containing it. If you think this is wrong, let me
	  know and I'll try something else. Patch by Mike Alexander. BP

	  modules. It was a bit of work to debug a recent problem
	  (#564033) and I ended up tweaking gnc_module_load_common() a bit
	  to coax the error messages out. I slightly reorganized the code
	  in this function to accomplish two things: 1. Make the logic
	  clearer to someone new to the code (i.e., me) 2. If an optional
	  module is found, log any errors in loading it I tried to
	  maintain the original spirit of not squawking too much about
	  unfound optional modules while still generating messages about
	  legitimate problems. Patch by G. Paul Ziemba. BP
