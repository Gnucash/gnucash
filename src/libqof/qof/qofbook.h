    A QOF Book is a dataset.  It provides a single handle
    through which all the various collections of entities
    can be found.   In particular, given only the type of
    the entity, the collection can be found.

    Books also provide the 'natural' place to working with
    a storage backend, as a book can encapsulate everything
    held in storage.
