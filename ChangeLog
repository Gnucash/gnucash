	* Make it possible to post multiple invoices from the find dialog. GnuCash was crashing if you searched for all unposted invoices, selected two or more of them, and posted them.

2013-03-26 Geert Janssens 

	* Bug #696469 - renumbering subaccounts does not preserve original order

2013-03-24 Mike Evans 

	* Prevent line break in date column on hyphen.

2013-03-24 Mike Alexander 

	* Compile md5.c with "-fno-strict-aliasing". The function md5_finish_ctx dereferences type-punned pointers which breaks strict aliasing rules.

2013-03-23 Mike Alexander 

	* One more try to get initialization right. This doesn't change things unless --add-price-quotes is given.  If it is then it must be handled before gtk is initialized since DISPLAY might not be set which will cause gtk initialization to fail.  This happens when running the X version of GnuCash from launchd on a Mac to get price quotes updated.

2013-03-22 Christian Stimming 

	* Fix erroneous conversion from time64 to struct tm because the Sunday weekday has a different number in GDateTime vs. struct tm.

2013-03-22 Christian Stimming 

	* Fix memory leaks due to localtime -> gnc_localtime replacement in r22618, r22626, r22627

2013-03-22 Christian Stimming 

	* Again reorder the initialization in gnucash-bin: gtk_init_check must be called before gnc_module_system_init.

	* Set svn:eol-style property to LF on .h and .c that did not yet have it so far.

2013-02-23 Christian Stimming 

	* Also set svn:eol-style property LF on .js files so that the files will surely have LF line endings in SVN in all cases.

2013-02-23 Mike Evans 

	* Normalise line endings of min.js files.

2013-02-22 Geert Janssens

2013-02-21 Phil Longstaff 

	* Initial changes to budget view. 1) Splits gnc-budget-view.c/.h out from gnc-plugin-page-budget.c.  gnc-plugin-page-budget.c now creates a GncBudgetView and provides the overall UI and integration for it. 2) GncBudgetView changes:     a) If an account has children but does not have a specific budget value for a period, the sum of the children's budget values will be displayed in gray     b) Totals column on the right provides total for a budget row (account)     c) At the bottom, totals lines with total income, total expenses, total transfers (assets+liabilities) and grand total (income - expenses - transfers)

2013-02-08 Mike Evans 

	* Bug 683881 Partial implementation.

2013-02-06 Mike Alexander 

	* Avoid a crash when entering invalid dates (e.g., enter "111" for a transaction date). gnc_parse_date is ignoring the return code from qof_scan_date which causes it to send uninitialized values to gnc_mktime which crashes if the date is too ridiculous. Presumably this worked before because mktime took anything without crashing.

2013-02-05 J. Alex Aycinena 

	* Update txf.scm to reflect changes to US Income Tax Forms and Schedules for 2012.

2013-02-04 Mike Alexander 

	* Use gnc-commodity-equiv to compare commodites, not equal?

2013-02-04 Mike Alexander

2013-02-04 Mike Alexander 

	* Improve HTML account table generator

2013-01-30 Mike Alexander 

	* Do a better job of calculating debit and credit fractions. Make gnc_split_register_set_cell_fractions agree with gnc_split_register_get_debcred_entry. If the account for a split changes recalculate the fractions.

2013-01-30 Mike Alexander 

	* Do a better job of prompting for an exchange rate only when needed. If the debit or credit value of a split changes, prompt for an exchange rate. Don't prompt for an exchange rate in a register that doesn't have a rate cell (and fix a bug so that it knows that portfolio registers don't have one). If the transaction has been autofilled and edited start with a nearby rate from the prices DB.  If it is an existing transaction start with the exchange rate it already has.

2013-01-22 Mike Alexander 

	* Don't store a negative reconcile interval.
