Finance::Quote 
==============

IMPORTANT
=========

Read Documentation/License for the license (GPL) covering this code.

Dependancies
------------
Finance::Quote depends upon a number of other perl modules to
function correctly.  These modules include:

	LWP::UserAgent
	HTTP::Request::Common
	HTML::TableExtract

You will receive a warning during the make process if one or more of
these modules are missing.

One easy way to install the modules that Finance::Quote requires is
to use perl's CPAN module:

	hostname$ perl -MCPAN -e shell (as root)

If you haven't used the CPAN module before, then it may ask you a few
simple configuration questions before you get to the cpan> prompt.
You can install any module from CPAN using:

	cpan> install my::module

Indeed, it's possible to install Finance::Quote and all the modules
it depends upon using:

	cpan> install Finance::Quote

Install instructions
--------------------

$ perl Makefile.PL
$ make
$ make test		(optional)
# make install		(as root)

Couldn't be easier, could it?

The tests do take some time to run (especially the currency test), so
please be patient.

What if my tests fail?
----------------------
Your tests could fail if your machine does not have a connection to the
Internet, if your machine must use an HTTP proxy and you do not have
your http_proxy environment variable set, or if one or more of the
servers that Finance::Quote uses is down or unhappy.

The tests can also fail if you have not installed all the modules
that Finance::Quote depends upon.  See the section on dependancies
above.
