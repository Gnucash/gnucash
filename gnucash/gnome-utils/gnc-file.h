/*
 * FILE: gnc-file.h
 *
 * FUNCTION:
 * A set of file-handling utilities for GnuCash applications.
 * These utilities will "do the right thing" when used in the "File..."
 * pulldown menu, for the "New", "Open", "Save", "SaveAs", etc. menu entries.
 * In particular, they will verify that old files don't get clobbered,
 * they'll put up dialogue boxes to ask the user to confirm their actions,
 * etc.
 *
 * These utilities are written in a GUI-independent fashion, and should
 * work just fine with the Motif, gnome/gtk and Qt interfaces.
 * These utilities are appropriate for direct invocation from guile.
 *
 * These GUI utilities implement and maintain a single global "session"
 * that defines the currently edited account group.  In a sense, these
 * functions provide the GUI for the qof_session object.  The session
 * is essentially a file that is open for editing, with locks on it
 * to prevent other readers and writers from accessing it as long as its
 * open.
 *
 *
 * The gnc_file_save() routine will check for an existing edit session,
 *    and if one exists, it will save the account info to a file.
 *    If an error occurs, a popup dialogue will inform the user of
 *    the error.  If there is no existing filename open, then the
 *    user will be prompted for a file to save to (using the
 *    gnc_file_save_as() routine).  The existing session will remain
 *    open for further editing.
 *
 * The gnc_file_save_as() routine will prompt the user for a filename
 *    to save the account data to (using the standard GUI file dialogue
 *    box).  If the user specifies a filename, the account data will be
 *    saved. If an error occurs, a popup dialogue will inform the user
 *    of the error.  One possible error is that another user has
 *    the indicated file already locked up in a different session
 *    (in which case it is up to the user to try again, or to pick
 *    a different filename).  If it is possible to save without
 *    an error, then a new session is started for the indicated
 *    filename, locking out other users.  This new session remains
 *    open for further editing.
 *
 * The gnc_file_query_save() routine will display a popup dialog asking
 *    the user if they wish to save their current work. If they answer
 *    "yes", their work will be saved (using the gncFileSave function),
 *    otherwise no action will be performed. If there is no currently
 *    locked session, a popup will query the user for a filename
 *    (using the gnc_file_save_as() routine). The routine will return
 *    TRUE if the user hits "Yes" or "No" and FALSE if the user
 *    hits "Cancel". If nothing needed to be saved, the routine
 *    will return TRUE.
 *
 * The gnc_file_new() routine will check for an existing edit session.
 *    If one exists, it will ask the user if they want to save it,
 *    (using the gnc_file_query_save_as() dialogue).  Then the current
 *    session will be destroyed, file locks will be removed, and
 *    account group structures will be set up for a new session.
 *
 * The gnc_file_open() routine check for an existing edit session.
 *    If one exists, it will ask the user if they want to save it.
 *    (using the gnc_file_query_save() dialogue).  Next, the user will
 *    be prompted with a GUI standard file-selection dialogue to
 *    to pick a new file.  If no file is picked, this routine returns.
 *    If a new file was picked, then the current session will be
 *    destroyed and file locks on it will be removed.  The new
 *    file will then be opened for editing, establishing locks, etc.
 *    If an error occurs, the user will be informed with a pop-up
 *    dialogue.  If the file cannot be found, or if a read
 *    error occurs, a popup describing the error will pop up.
 *    One possible error is that another user has the indicated
 *    file already locked up in a different session (in which
 *    case it is up to the user to try again, or to pick
 *    a different filename).
 *
 * The gnc_file_revert() routine will discard any changes since the last
 * time the session was saved (but only after user confirmation).
 *
 * The gnc_file_open_file() routine behaves much like the gnc_file_open()
 *    routine, except that the new file to open is passed as a char *
 *    argument.
 *
 * The gnc_file_export() routine will check for an existing edit
 *    session, and if one exists, it will save just the commodities
 *    and accounts to a file.  If an error occurs, a popup dialogue
 *    will inform the user of the error.
 *
 * The gnc_file_quit() routine will close out and destroy the current session.
 *    The user WILL NOT BE PROMPTED to confirm this action, or do do
 *    any kind of saving beforehand.
 *
 * HISTORY:
 * Derived from Rob Clark's original MainWindow.c code, Dec 1998
