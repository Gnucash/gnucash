/** @name Gobject Tracking Functions
 *  @{
 *
 *  This set of functions is used to maintain a "database" of objects
 *  that are built on top of a GObject (any level of nesting).  This
 *  database is simply a hash table of lists.  The hash table takes
 *  the object name as its key and returns a list of all objects of
 *  that type.  The object is then added to, deleted from, or looked
 *  up in the list.  The database can also be queried for a list of
 *  all objects of a specified type.  This can be used to find
 *  pre-existing GncTreeModels, etc.  (In this case performing a
 *  search for a specific object wouldn't help because the information
 *  being inspected is private to the object.)
 *
 *  Any object added to this database during the execution of gnucash
 *  should be deleted from it before completion of the program.  WHen
 *  the program shuts down, a list of all objects still in the
 *  database will be dumped out to the logfile.  This should help
 *  developers find memory leaks in their code where an object is
 *  lost, or is not release because it gained an extra reference at
 *  some point during its lifetime.

/** Tell gnucash to remember this object in the database.
 *
 *  @param object The object to be tracked.  This can be a fully or
 *  partially instantiated object.
 *
 *  @param klass The class structure for the object.  This argument
 *  may be NULL if a fully instantiated object is passed in as the
 *  first argument.  If a partially instantiated object is provided
 *  (I.E. a parent class called this function) then this argument is
 *  required.  This is necessary because the class of the object
 *  changes as each of the parent class is instantiated.  The class
 *  structure, however, status constant and always reflects the fully
 *  instantiated object.
