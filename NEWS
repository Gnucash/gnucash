Some other fixes not associated with reported bugs were accomplished:

    Add business lot scrubbing to Check & Repair->All/This transaction(s).
    Add context to generic translatable string. This was suggested in
    	Bug 671615 by JÃ©rÃ´me Rapinat.
    Add scrub function to reduce the amount of lot links used. Only lot links
    	between two or more document lots must remain. All lot links between
	document and payment lots can be scrubbed.
    Add some date format checking and make sure generated dates are the correct
    	user selected format, not always locale format.
    Allow the ability to skip rows when importing transactions.
    Always use the price we display to calculate the current value of an
    	account.
    Better period totals formatting in Invoices.
    CSV Export: factor out function to generate regular expression.
    CSV Import transform macro into function.
    Convert ISO-8859-1 account chart templates to UTF-8.
    Correct txf output to use a minus sign, rather than parenthesis.
    Fix document type dispay for credit notes on owner report.
    Fix test-backend-dbi segfault with libdbi-0.9.0.
    Handle the case of scrubbing a lot link between two non-document lots.
    Make scrub in lot viewer scrub business lots using the new scrub functions.
    Move account type checking functions into the engine.
    Prevent older gnucash versions from opening a data file if previously
    	unhandled kvps are used.
    Python bindings. Add function gncVendorNextID, complementary to
        gncCustomerNextID.
    Re-enable loading and saving gnucashdotdir/accelerator-home on OSX.
    Refactor OS-specific ifdef to reduce code duplication, which results
        in reduced risk on typos in either branch
    Refactor get_pay_split into gncOwnerFindOffsettingSplit. In this form it
        can be used both for scrubbing lot links and for adding new payments
    Refactor gncOwnerReduceSplitTo out of reduce_biggest_split. It can now be
        used both for scrubbing and when applying payments
    Refactor gnc_doc_doc_link into gncOwnerSetLotLinkMemo and move it. It can
        now be used both for scrubbing and when applying payments
    Refactor scrub_doc_pay_link into scrub_other_link and make it more generic.
        It can now be used both to:
        * move a payment to a document lot (its original use case)
        * move a refund to a payment lot or the other way around
    Relax requirements for booleans in invoice line, accepting 'y' as well as
        'yes', 't' as well as 'true'.
    Replace C++ reserved words for future compatibility with C++.
    Rework assistant csv import regex code to eliminate the mandatory dummy
        field.
    Rewrite invoice payment logic to fix lot link proliferation.
    SQL: Save commodity namespace changes from template.
    Set default currency for French account chart templates.
    Tweak the get_pay_split function to prefer the best possible match.
    Use libsecret if available since gnome-keyring has been deprecated.
    Use more significant digits for SX function returns.
    Use same default setting for quotes in csv import and export.
    Widen the scope of the subsplit merge scrub function. When used in a
        strict sense it will only merge splits that are marked as subsplits
	of each other. In relaxed mode it will merge any split two splits
	that are both in the same lot and the same transaction.
    double_to_gnc_numeric: Return overflow error immediately on invalid input.
    Ensure that the root account is saved to the SQL backend.

2.6.0 - 29 Dec 2013

       The GnuCash development team proudly announces GnuCash 2.6.0,
       the latest stable release of the GnuCash Free Accounting
       Software. GnuCash Users can experience the following new features:

       * Preferences have been migrated from GConf to GSettings. This
	 is a simpler and more robust backend which writes to the OS's
	 native prefs -- defaults on OS X and the Registry on
	 MSWindows -- and allows us to remove several troublesome
	 dependencies including GConf, ORBit, and DBus. The change
	 includes a migration script that will run at Gnucash startup.

       * New date handling which allows GnuCash to use dates after March 2038.

       * Guile-2 compatibility: GnuCash now requires either Guile-1.8
         or Guile-2.0

       * Documents outside of GnuCash, images of receipts for example,
         can now be linked to transactions, with the facility of
         opening them in the default application for the document
         type.

       * Cutsom Reports can now be saved without renaming the report,
         and modifications can overwrite an existing report.

       * The import assistant now finishes much more quickly after
         assigning contra-accounts.

       * GnuCash now requires Gtk+-2.24.0 and GLib-2.26.0. Most of the
         dependencies on obsolete libraries have been removed; only
         libgnomecanvas remains. Unfortunately the effort to rewrite
         the register code to use GtkTreeModel wasn't completed in
         time, so GnuCash is not on the cusp of converting to Gtk3.

       * The Business Module has been substantially revamped,
         including support for Credit Notes and import of customers
         and vendors from a CSV file.

       * The Num field in the register display is now optionally
         per-split, so for example a check number can be entered for
         the checking account split and an invoice number for the
         expense account split.

       * GnuCash can now open locked books read-only so that more than
         one user can view a file. GnuCash still does not support
         multiple simultaneous writers.

       * By agreement of all authors, GnuCash is now licensed under
         the GNU General Public License Version 2 or later rather than
         simply Version 2. This allows derivative works to be licensed
         under the GPL Version 3 if the author of such a work so
         desires.

       * Fixed more than 500 bugs.

       For those keeping score, the following changes have occurred
       since 2.5.10:

       Bug Fixes:

       157247 - Asset account's "total" value should use most
                recent transaction prices
       710823 - libofx can supply broken UTF-8 for account id
       710824 - GnuCash should sanitise UTF-8 before serialising files
                to avoid writing broken unparseable XML.
       720555 - General Ledger - Can't Enter Transaction Amounts
       720556 - The Tip of the Day preference isn't getting saved
       720646 - New Book Tabs on Windows

       Other Changes:

       * Don't create a second account hierarchy page when cancelling
         the Hierarchy Assistant or when using Actions->New Account
         Hierarchy on an already open book.

       * Reset Warnings dialog: show translated warnings

       * The locale-names for Help and the Tutorial and Concepts Guide
         have been renamed to language-only so that, for example,
         someone using the Swiss-German locale will be shown help in
         German instead of English.

      Translations Updated: British, Dutch, French, Italian, Lithuanian.

2.5.10 - 15 December 2013
         This is the eleventh and final release in the UNSTABLE 2.5 series.
	 It is the second beta release. Barring any surprises, we will release
	 a STABLE 2.6.0 on 29 December.

	 Changes since the last release have been entirely bug fixes
	 and translation updates, though not all bug fixes had
	 associated bug reports. Note that WebKit 1.2 is now tested
	 for in configure; it had been 1.0, but GnuCash wouldn't
	 actually compile with versions earlier than 1.1.5.

	 Bug Fixes:

	 336843 - Attach images/files/urls to transactions:
	          Disable the "show attachment" menu item if the transaction
	          has no attached file.

	          during qif import
	 708526 - GnuCash Crashes when opening About page:
	          Downgrade the error to a critical warning.
	 711317 - Indian Rupee Symbol appears as "?" marks
	 715123 - Post invoice problem, cannot unpost
	 719481 - GnuCash report crashes with Guile2
	 719521 - Missing radio button in "Edit security" dialog
	 719726 - Click on File -> Open seg-faults
	 720235 - Python bindings should load environment file just
	          like gnucash does
	 Fix Python tests to no longer require gsettings schemas installed.
	 Fix the CuteCash (Qt GUI based) build
	 Multi-currency "Post invoice" improvements
	 Protect gnc_mktime against bad dates.
	 Protect against null account pointers in a couple of place to
	     avoid asserts.
	 Qif Import Assistant: Don't disable the whole dialog, just the
	     Forward button
	 QifImport: Fix crash from attempting to import an empty file.
	 Add the ability to search for transactions that are, or are not,
	     book closing entries.
	 Move customer, bill, and invoice importers form the business menu
	     to the file menu.
	 Rename some directories in src/import-export so that the
	     gschema.xml.in.in files within them don't have pathnames that
	     are too long for tar when the GnuCash version exceeds 5 digits
	     (e.g., 2.5.10).

	 Translation Updates: Italian, German, French
	 New Translations: Arabic!

2.5.9 - 1 December 2013
         This is the tenth release in the UNSTABLE 2.5 series.
	 It is the first beta release.

	 Barring any surprises, there will be one more beta release in
	 two weeks, followed by the release of 2.6.0 on 29 December.

	 Changes since the last release have principally been code
	 cleanup, including KVP storage in the SQL Backend, Python
	 testing in out-of-source builds, test failures when using
	 Guile-2, ensure that saved state (especially KVP) is deleted
	 along with the primary object, use the progress bar when
	 loading the PriceDB.

	 Translator note: We found it advisable to correct some typos
	 and to add two translatable strings "Bill Information" and
	 "Voucher Information".

	 Bug Fixes:
	 644044 - Lots: SQL backend loses link to Gain/Loss Txn
 	 704506 - Connection loss to mysql after resume from hibernation

 2.5.8 - 17 November 2013

         This is the ninth release in the UNSTABLE 2.5 series. This
         release is the last alpha release.

	 String and feature freeze are now in effect: Only bug fixes
	 which have no effect on UI, API, or translatable strings
	 should be committed to trunk until after the release of
	 GnuCash 2.6, currently scheduled for 29 December 2013.

	 Translators: Please use the tarballs from this release to
	 prepare your translations.

	 New contributor Patrick has provided a beginning
	 implementation of linking attachments to transactions. This
	 is accessed through the Transaction menu and the transaction
	 context menu. In this initial version, linked files are
	 displayed in the default viewer for the file type. E.g., html
	 files will open in a browser and jpegs will open in the
	 default picture viewer.

	 Bug Fixes:
	 707311 - Tax Invoice fails to open when using guile 2
	 709589 - make check fails with guile 2
	 711289 - Time Zone Handling is Inconsistent between 2.4 and 2.5

	 Translations Updated: German

 2.5.7 - 3 November 2013
       	 This is the eighth release in the UNSTABLE 2.5 series.

	 Register2 is now a configure option. Default builds,
	 including the Windows and Mac All-in-one packages, will use
	 only the old register. We've decided that it isn't ready for
	 general use and the principal author doesn't have time to
	 make it ready in time for a 2.6 release.

	 Frédéric Perrin has contributed a change to display currency
	 symbols whenever they are known and unambiguous.

	 Geert Janssens has cleaned up most of the issues from the
	 initial GSettings preference changes. There's a new
	 configure option, --with-xdg-data-dirs to overide the
	 environment and defaults if necessary.

	 Building Gnucash now requires Automake version 1.11 or later.

	 Configure will abort if --enable-ofx is set but no libofx
	 configuration files are found.  Budget periods may no longer
	 set to values greater than the budget's num_periods, and the
	 budget options descriptions will wrap. Contributed by Robert
	 Ratliff.

	 Bug Fixes:

	 668530 - In budget flow report options, change the maximum
	       value for period to 60 (Note the FIXMEs) Author: Robert
	       Ratliff

	 687479 - Automatic invoice/payment matching on posting an
	       invoice should be an optional feature

	       Remove unneeded gnc_plugin_page_budget_refresh_cb
	       Author: R Ratliff

	 710739 - Fill in field for remote bank account information
	       also for SEPA transfers.

	       installed to default location

      	 Translations Updated: None

 2.5.6 - 7 October 2013
       	 This is the seventh release in the UNSTABLE 2.5 series.

	 Geert Janssens has rewritten the preferences system to use
	 GSettings from GIO (GLib) instead of GConf. This is a simpler
	 and more robust backend which writes to the OS's native prefs
	 -- defaults on OS X and the Registry on MSWindows -- and
	 allows us to remove several troublesome dependencies
	 including GConf, ORBit, and DBus. The change includes a
	 migration script that will run at Gnucash startup.

	 WARNING: the saved settings in gconf are not (yet) migrated
         to gsettings !  running gnucash as of this commit will start
         you with default values for all preferences !  You can of
         course change your preferences, your changes will be saved
         properly in gsettings and restored when you restart
         gnucash. But what has been set in GConf before will basically
         be ignored.

 2.5.4 - 4 August 2013
         This is the fifth release in the UNSTABLE 2.5 series.

	 New Features:

	 Register2 work: Restore the delete-transaction-up/down
	 feature, replace the filter-and-sort model with a qof query
	 which loads only a subset of transactions to improve speed,
	 and some date and cursor changes.

	 Customized report settings can now be saved without renaming
	 the report, and updates saved directly replacing the previously
	 saved report or "saved as" to a new name.

	 It's now possible to post multiple invoices from the find
	 dialog. GnuCash was crashing if you searched for all unposted
	 invoices, selected two or more of them, and posted them.
	 This was because the list of invoices to be posted changed
	 while it was being processed.  As part of fixing this the
	 prompt for post date, due date, etc. will only be given once,
	 not once per invoice.

	 Register2 work: Better commodity/currency handling, sanity checks
	 when converting TreePaths, Posted Dates now work like the old Register,

	 information in a JSON format.

	 Christian Stimming fixed the very long wait time for the UI to
	 become responsive when running the import matcher.

	 Also some bug fixes, package upgrades, and minor improvements.

 2.5.0 - 30 Mar 2013

         The Gnucash Development Team is pleased to release Gnucash 2.5.0,
	 the first release of an unstable series leading to Gnucash 2.6.0.

	 This release is UNSTABLE and SHOULD NOT BE USED in production.

	 Robert Fewell has contributed a rewrite of the ledger
	 (Gnucash's primary interface window) to use the GtkTreeModel
	 (select "register 2" from the menu) as well as a new CSV
	 import/export facility for account trees.

	 Gnucash now requires Gtk+-2.24 and GLib-2.26. We've removed
	 most of the dependencies on libraries obsoleted by project
	 Ridley and will be in position to move to Gtk+-3.x once the
	 GtkTreeModel register window work is complete. This means
	 that Gnucash 2.5 requires Debian 6, RHEL 6, or one of the
	 more aggressive distributions like Ubuntu.

	 Gnucash now works with Guile-2.0.

	 The business module has been revamped and we introduce a new
	 feature, Credit Notes. It is now possible to import customers
	 and vendors from a CSV file as well.

	 The "Num" field is now optionally per-split rather than
	 per-transaction.

	 When opening a locked "book" one now has the option of
	 opening it read-only. Note that Gnucash is still a
	 single-user program and that the database backends are still
	 used only as a data store.

	 Gnucash is no longer subject to the "2038" bug, so that
	 30-year mortgages can now be entered correctly.

	 By agreement of all authors we have relicensed Gnucash to the
	 Gnu Public License Version 2 or later from just Version 2.

       for users.

 2.4.0 - 20 Dec 2010

       The GnuCash development team proudly announces GnuCash 2.4.0,
       the latest stable release of the GnuCash Free Accounting
       Software. With this new release series, GnuCash can use an SQL
       database using SQLite3, MySQL or PostgreSQL. It runs on
       GNU/Linux, *BSD, Solaris, Microsoft Windows and Mac OSX.

       Major changes in the 2.4.0 release include

       * In addition to the XML backend, Gnucash can now use a
         SQLite3, MySQL or PostgreSQL database to store the data. This
         is a new implementation using libdbi. It supports all
         features including the business features.  In order to build
         with this, add --enable-dbi to the configure command.  In
         addition to the libdbi-dev package for your distribution, you
         will also need the appropriate DBD (libdbi driver) package
         for sqlite3, mysql or postgresql.

       * As a replacement for the current GtkHTML HTML engine used to
         display reports and graphs, Gnucash can use WebKit. WebKit is
         the engine used by Google Chrome on Windows and Safari on
         Apple.  In order to build with this, add
         --with-html-engine=webkit to the configure command.  You will
         need an appropriate webkit-dev package.  On win32, you will
         need to download the webkit-1.1.90-win32.zip file from the
         source repository and put it into the downloads directory of
         your gnucash build area.

       * Updated AqBanking on Win32.</li>
 
 2.3.0 - 14 May 2009
 	 o Welcome to GnuCash 2.3.0 the first of several unstable releases of
	 the GnuCash Open Source Accounting Software which will eventually lead
	 to the stable version 2.4.0. This release is the very first to use an
	 SQLite3 database as the default data store.  It is intended for
	 developers and adventurous testers who want to help tracking down bugs.
	 o WARNING WARNING WARNING - Make sure you make backups of any files
	 used in testing versions of GnuCash in the 2.3.x series. Although the
	 developers go to great lengths to ensure that no data will be lost we
	 cannot guarentee that your data will not be affected if for some
	 reason GnuCash crashes in testing these releases.
	 o PLEASE TEST TEST AND TEST SOME MORE any and all features important
	 to you. Then post any bugs you find to bugzilla
	 http://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=GnuCash
	 o If you have the urge to help beyond testing please get involved in
	 the discussions on the GnuCash mailing lists which you will find at
	 http://www.gnucash.org.  Please see http://wiki.gnucash.org/wiki/Development
	 on how to get involved.
	 o Major new features:
	    * All features, including business features, are supported by a new
		SQL datastore, which can use SQLite3 (default), MySQL or PostgreSQL.
		The legacy XML data format is still supported
		* Replacement of the aging GtkHTML engine used for reports/charts
		with the WebKit engine used by Apple's Safari and Google's Chrome
		web browsers.
	 o PS I'm not going to list the many minor features changed or updated in
	 this release because obviously there is so much that has changed.

 2.2.0 - 14 July 2007
  	 o Welcome to the GnuCash 2.2.0 Release.
	 o With this new release series, GnuCash is available on Microsoft
	 Windows for the first time, and it also runs on GNU/Linux, *BSD,
	 Solaris and Mac OSX.
	 o This release has only a few user-visible new features, except for
	 the completed port to the Microsoft Windows operating system. In
	 summary, the following features are new, compared to the older 2.0.x
	 series:
	 o Port to Microsoft Windows completed. Note that Windows 2000, XP, or
	 Vista is required; GnuCash does not run on Windows 98 or 95.
	 o Data file notice: In version 2.1.2 the format for scheduled
	 transactions in the data file was changed. Files using the old format
	 will be read without problems by this new version, but the new
	 version of GnuCash only writes the new format. The new file format
	 cannot be loaded by older versions of GnuCash. (If you try, the file
	 will fail to be loaded with an error message.) As a result, if you
	 begin using the new Gnucash, and you have data files with scheduled
	 transactions, then these files will not be readable by older
	 versions. If you have to make a new data file readable by older
	 versions of GnuCash, this can be achived by deleting all records of
	 scheduled transactions in the scheduled transaction editor.
	 o SWIG is now used instead of g-wrap for providing language bindings.
	 o The Scheduled Transaction list view is now improved and summarized
	 more compactly. The Since-Last-Run dialog has been simplified.
	 o Check printing has been improved, with new formats and simpler
	 format descriptions.
	 o Automatic saving of the data file was added.
	 o Bugfixes and improvements since the last version 2.1.5 include:
	 o Updated translations.
	 o Improved handling of Online Banking wizard on Windows.

	 o Welcome to GnuCash 2.1.5 aka "Release Candidate 2", the fifth of

 1.8.12 - 19 Oct 2005
 	 o Online Banking/HBCI improvements: Debit notes are fixed
 	 again; Bank-internal money transfers are now supported, if
 	 the HBCI bank offers them; Setup wizard can now works with
 	 HBCI, OFX-Connect, and other AqBanking backends; Fix
 	 character encoding issues in utf-8 locales; Fix date interval
 	 in the import transaction matcher for OFX and HBCI import;

 	 o Add configure macros for mips, mipsel, arm, and m68k; Fix
 	 compilation on OpenBSD 64bit architectures
 	 o Updated translations: German, Italian, Kinyarwanda

 1.8.11 - 06 Feb 2005
 	 o Add extra sanity checks and verbose error message if the setup
	 wizard of aqhbci cannot be found.
	 o Fix potentially missing initialization of gwenhywfar library, as
	 reported by Peter O'Gorman on Max OS X.
	 o Properly accumulate splits (bug #165053).  Also fixes a (related)
	 memory leak
	 o Add explicit dependency on business-utils.
	 o Adapt to latest changes in aqbanking; external wizard name is no
	 longer hard-coded here but is asked from aqbanking.
	 o Enable debit notes again in HBCI.
	 o Update German translation.
	 o Thomas Bushnell's patch to protect non-backup pruning (#164875)
	 o Add the transaction guid to some error warning messages.
	 o Fix HBCI date range for statement download.
	 o Fix the last-day-of-month computation for leap years.
	 
 1.8.10 - 11 Dec 2004
 	 o Don't use C++/C99 declarations.  Declare variables at the top of
	 the function.
	 o Updated British English, Czech, Italian, Russian, German,
	 Brazilian Portugese, Dutch, French, Spanish, translations.
	 o Fabien COELHO's zero-balance patch to remove accounts of zero
	 balance from the report.
	 o Fix a broken recursion problem.  Don't call show-acct? from
	 use-acct? so we don't recurse ad flictum.  This recursive call isn't
	 necessary, just have use-acct? recurse unto itself.
	 o look in ${srcdir} for build-config.scm.in
	 o Work around problems with libltdl3.
	 o don't automatically try to (require 'format), so gnucash will build
	 on an slib-3 system.
	 o Added quote sources for Indian Mutual Funds.
	 o Skip the case when a token is the empty string. This caused many
	 warnings about a NULL kvp_frame lookup.

	 o guile-1.6 complains about string->symbol when passed a symbol.
	 o applied Vasil's patch to improve the transaction report for HTML
	 export purposes.
	 o Backport of CVS-head changes to improve register open performance
	 when working with large account trees (>500 accounts).  The new code
	 caches the quickfill tree so that it is shared by all register
	 windows.
	 o create gnc:current-saved-reports, as the file to store saved
	 reports from cstim.  Autoload the saved-reports file at startup
	 (after config.user/config.auto is loaded).
	 o Added gnc:report-generate-saved-forms that will generate the scheme
	 code necessary to create a new report from the saved options of an
	 old report.
	 o Added example Menu item "File -> Save all reports" that will call
	 the new report saving function for all reports. This would need more
	 work so that not all reports are saved but only the currently
	 selected one -- any volunteer may feel free to add that.
	 o Fix saving of report: It now appends to
	 ~/.gnucash/saved-reports-1.8 Statusbar tip is now more verbose.
	 o Add toolbar element for saving the current report.
	 o Add function for saving one particular report to the
	 ~/.gnucash/saved-reports-1.8 file. Add extra menu only for customized
	 reports.
	 o Remove the previous function for saving all reports since it is no
	 longer necessary.
	 o Apply David Reiser's patch for Quicken(tm) cheques with stub.
	 o Apply David Grant's patch to add TD Efunds.
	 o make the desktop file HIG compliant.
	 o change the gtkhtml order to search for >= 1.1 before < 1.1, in
	 order to try to fix #84707 on systems with multiple versions of
	 gtkhtml.
	 o Perry Smith's Null Account Patch.  Make sure the security is a real
	 string before appending an account separator, so we don't try to
	 create a "null" account.
	 o Add option to include zero-amount splits in computations.
	 o fix xaccAccountGetBalanceAsOfDate() to properly compute the balance
	 at the end of the split list.
	 o Major change for HBCI, back-ported from HEAD. The HBCI online
	 banking is no longer based on the openhbci library but instead on the
	 aqbanking library http://sf.net/projects/aqbanking which is Martin
	 Preuss' successor of openhbci. This means that now aqbanking-0.9.5 is
	 required instead of any openhbci package.
	 o Fixes for x86_64
	 o Update for new LibOfx, this among other things, gives gnucash
	 Microsoft OFC support.
	 o Duplicate match tweaks in import code
	 o Andreas Rottmann's patch to support g-wrap 1.9.
	 o provide a default account name so we don't crash when someone
	 imports a broken QIF that has a !Account without an account name.
	 o Daniel Lindenaar's patch to implement a check-box in the Invoice
	 Post Dialog (with a default in the File Preferences) to choose to
	 accumulate splits when posting an invoice, or post a 1:1 mapping.
	 o Phil Longstaff's patch to prevent duplicate pricedb entries.
	 o Heath Martin's x86_64 patch
	 o Mark search criteria for translation -- somehow this had been
	 missed all the time.
	 o Change currency mnemonic for "New Israeli Shekel" from "ILS" to
	 "NIS".
	 o Identified and fixed several places with untranslated strings.
	 o Add configure check for libofx version 0.7.0 and respective error
	 message. Update docs.
	 o Improve importer performance by matching imported transactions only
	 against transactions in the proper time interval.
	 o send an event when a payment is processed so the invoice gets
	 updated as "paid" in the search window.
	 o Make sure we set the proper search-type when we create the query,
	 otherwise the search will fail later.

 1.8.9  - 11 Apr 2004
 	 o Updated Polish translation by GNOME PL Team, updated French, Czech,
	   Spanish, Russian, Dutch, German and Italian translations.
	 o dump-finance-quote - Be more explicit when a lookup fails.
	 o log-replay - Increase read buffer size.
	 o Make sure to verify that the items in the reconcile hash are still
	   around after a refresh.
	 o When the commodity is changed, then set the currency to the
	   currency of the last price entered for this commodity.
	 o Add Hungarian account templates by Sulyok Peter
	 o Patch by Geoff Kassel to work on OpenBSD (allow user to set
	   diffcmd).
	 o Don't test double KVPs, on the theory that they will soon be
	   deprecated.
	 o  When computing the aging report, ignore splits that belong to
	   closed lots.  This way we wont get the wrong values when the invoice
	   falls outside the 360-day window but its payment falls inside the
	   window.
	 o Add gnc_getline() function to read an unlimited line-length from a
	   file (so you're not limited to a buffer size with fgets() and the
	   like). It is similar to the getline(3) on Linux except the API is
	   different and it will always set the return string.
	 o Add workaround code for openhbci/chipcard problem.
	 o Add gnc_lookup_date_option() function.
	 o Add gnc_ui_account_get_balance_in_currency() function.
	 o Add preferences for summarybar.
	 o Add xaccAccountConvertBalanceToCurrencyAsOfDate() function
	 o Summarybar can now display a grand total of all commodities,
	   profits of a period of time and net assets at the end of the period;
	   summarybar can be configured with some options under
	   edit->preferences.
	 o Create two new functions to centralize date-selection option
	   creation.
	 o Export the new scheme functions.
	 o Modify Herbert's patch to centralize the date-selection option
	   code.
	 o Use the new centralized date-selection option-creation code.
	 o Fix a typo in the help (was --diable-gui).
	 o Add db-4.2 to the list of databases we search.
	 o Fix a problem with opt style installs.
	 o Rename from_xxx and to_xxx account tree widgets to left_xxx and
	   right_xxx.
	 o If in "accountant mode" call "transfer from" "credit account" and
	   "transfer to" "debit account" and interchange account trees.
	 o Remove the RECN cell from payable/receivable to stop confusing
	   people.
	 o Change Ukrainian "UAG" into "UAH"
	 o Commented out setting the memo always to "Auto-created split" due
	   to popular request.
	 o Fix for part of bug only allow auto-create SXes which have splits 
	   to be created.
	 o HBCI transfer template management GUI added by Bernd Wagner.
	 o Added instructions about running under valgrind.
	 o Added a large set of valgrind suppressions for both guile and
	   gnucash.
	 o Change the reg_type to SEARCH_LEDGER so all the 'action' types
	   appear.
	 o Remove unused 'ledger_status' widget.
	 o At least be consistent about the background coloring of the month
	   labels, even if we're still not using GTK themeage correctly.
	 o Destroy the transient window when the widget is destroyed.
	 o Make the advance and remind spin-buttons editable.
	 o Change the upper bound on the advance and remind spins to 365
	   [days], with a page-size of 30 [days].
	 o Disallow the Scheduling of being-editing transactions in the
	   Register, preventing a class of unbalacned SX template transactions
	   from being entered and propogated through the system.
	 o Fix nasty memory-corruption issue; insufficent bounds checking on
	   array index.
	 o Better handling of various error cases in transaction-creation.
	 o When we have a problem parsing a credit/debit cell, indicate to the
	   user what occurred.
	 o Use the account-list filtering capability of the GncAccountSel to
	   only show/allow-creation-of valid account-types in the loan-druid.
	 o Add ':' to the token list of allowable characters in the formula
	   cell.
	 o Fix precedence bug screwing up loan review page.
	 o Don't need to require format; main.scm handles it, and the default
	   "format" (simple-format) is sufficient to handle everything we need.
	   This allows gnucash to work with slib3.
	 o Add code to remove "intl/Makefile po/Makefile" from AC_OUTPUT in
	   configure.in prior to calling gettextize to make sure that you can
	   build from CVS with recent versions of gettextize.  Tested with both
	   RH9 and RH7.3 to make sure it works with both old and new.
	 o Move variable declaration to the top of the block.
	 o Make sure we always have intl and po Makefiles in the configure
	   script.  Sometimes it was ripped out without being replaced.

 1.8.8  - 17 Nov 2003
 	 o HBCI - Improve error message when receiving zero balance from bank.
	 o Add account template for Swiss German businesses "KMU" by Tom
	   Winterhalder

	   Schmidt
	 o Add Catalan and Turkish translation, Updated German, Italian,
	   Czech, Greek and Dutch translations.
	 o Add Turkish account template. Updated Greek account templates.
	 o Remove debian scripts
	 o Add a comment about minimum string length
	 o Fix the ISO_DATELEN to be "long enough"
	 o Fix handling of HBCI direct debits (fix wrong textkey). Fix and
	   initially implement handling of multiple banks/users/customers.
	 o Fixed extremly stupid, old bug that causes weird HBCI errors.
	   Improved user messages.
	 o Refactor some GUI code. Improve user messages.
	 o BillTermDecRef should have been BillTermIncRef when setting new
	   bill term.
	 o Applied Frank Pavageau's patch regarding capital gains to handle
	   split transactions.
	 o Don't make a timespec with tv_sec == 0.  Fixes some tests on the
	   alpha platform.
	 
 1.8.7  - 14 Sept 2003
 	 o Use <libofx/libofx.h> instead of "libofx/libofx.h" as it's not part
	   of our system. Fixes a dependency problem in 1.8.6 release.
	 o Small fix from hawkfan to get tests to work when building outside
	   srcdir.
	 o Fix a bug introduced by Matthew -- ANSI C does not allow you to
	   declare a variable in the middle of an expression.  Move the
	   declaration to the top of the function.
	 o We don't need the trailing semi-colon because the #include adds
	   one.  The double semi-colon causes build failures in some cases.

 1.8.6  - 11 Sept 2003
 	 o Updated Spanish, Greek, French, Czech, Slovak translations
	 o Fixed extremely stupid bug in the import value setting workaround.
	 o Fixed problem with SX formula_cell calls
	 o Merge missing part of 2003-05-28 commit.  The log format changes
	   didn't get commited for some reason, making the log replayer 
	   completely unusable.
	 o Fixed crash during dialog startup on Solaris.
	 o Turn off scheme garbage collection during query->scm and scm->query
	   conversion.  It shaves about 50% off the test-scm-query-string tests.
	 o Make test-scm-query-string test deterministic by seeding the RNG
	   with a known value.
	 o Add a "slots" parameter to allow for future expansion.  Right now
	   this is completely ignored.

 1.8.5  - 17 Aug 2003
 	 o Add IS_PAID column and the ability to search for paid/not-paid
	   invoices.
	 o Add HBCI online transfer templates and make usable
	 o Fix a bug where if you unpost an invoice and don't bring the
	   TaxTables up to date, the total value shown in the register is
	   different depending on whether the cursor is on the current line
	   or not.
	 o Don't constantly resize the invoice window every time we update
	   ourselves.
	 o Updated Italian, Brazilian Portugese, German, Czech, Dutch and
	   British English translation.
	 o Add Subtotal and Tax labels in the summary bar to print the
	   Invoice's total amounts.
	 o Change the log format to use GUID instead of C pointers, use
	   ISO8601 instead of proprietary form and log the Notes field.
	 o Port new log replay module from HEAD.
	 o Re-enable reversed legend in stacked barcharts. Needs Guppi 0.40.4
	   a.k.a. Guppi CVS, though, to actually work.
	 o Update the Polish Zloty for its new ISO currency code.
	 o Add ability to sort by Action and Notes.
	 o Fix the vendor window title to use the company name, not the
	   contact name. Change the message when the company name is left blank.
	 o Create a new "date format" widget to let the user choose a date
	   format (and see the results of what the date would look like).
	 o Add "Deluxe Personal Check" type. Add support for printing to
	   "deluxe" personal checks.  This prints the check "sideways" on a
	   US-Letter configuration.
	 o Backport the QueryList widget and associated usage (this allows
	   more places to have sortable column displays for query results)
	 o Improve HBCI error handling. Add more user feedback functions.
	 o Add support for KtoBlzCheck, a small checking package for
	   destination account numbers for German banks. Very small, very useful
	   http://sourceforge.net/projects/ktoblzcheck
	 o TRANSLATION_HOWTO: Added, by Jon Lapham
	 o Add API to the plugin modules to allow post-processing (scrubbing)
	   of the book after it is loaded from XML.  This allows a plug-in to
	   post-process the complete book.
	 o Create a scrub function to clear up bogus tax tables due to a bug
	   which could cause tax tables to get created ad-nausium if you post
	   and then unpost an invoice.
	 o Create a scrub function to clear up bogus bill terms due to a bug
	   which could cause bill terms to get created due to post/unpost of
	   invoices.
	 o Enable the exchange-rate dialog on "search ledger" registers.
	 o Raise the import window after choosing a file.
	 o Change dialog statements to allow for embedded percent signs in the
	   messages.  In other words, don't allow user input into the format
	   string of a printf.
	 o Change how the billterms option menu is used so it will change
	   properly if you change the invoice's owner.
	 o Don't use gnc:reverse-account-balance? to determine whether to
	   reverse the balance -- base it purely on the report type.
	 o Fix gncBillTermCopy() so it PROPERLY copies the bill term.
	 o Tolerate some HBCI banks failure of the GetSystemId-job.
	 o Don't allow selection of directory for save file.
	 o Add fancy-invoice report, to show what else is possible.  It's not
	   really useful per se, but it is another example for users.  To be
	   useful it requires some custom editing.
	 o Limit the commodity choices based upon the current account type.
	 o Add a new argument to the dialog creation functions to specify what
	   types of commodities should be presented.Also tweak the title of the
	   dialog based upon this argument.  Remove the "new" button when the
	   dialog is limited strictly to currencies.
	 o Show the running balance column by default in the register report.
	 o Annotate the window title to indicate whether a register is for a
	   single account or it includes all subaccounts.
	 o Change the register close dialog to include a cancel option.
	 o Don't close the register if the user cancelled.
	 o If the user has manually entered an amount, then stop automatically
	   updated the amount when the date is changed.
	 o Refactor many HBCI functions to eventually enable queued processing
	   of several HBCI jobs.
	 o Add a "retained earnings" item under equity, and change the title
	   to include the start date (Balance Sheet report).
	 o Don't print the "handling-request" messages when getting stock
	   quotes.
	 o Display selected pixmap when opening an options window.
	 o Fix 'Save As' so it can write to non-existing files.
	 o New data file should have same uid/gids original file.
	 o Added Italian account templates by Lorenzo Cappelletti
	 o Change HBCI online transfer action so that first the gnucash
	   Transaction is created and only after that the HBCI connection is
	   started. Necessary for later implementation of offline queueing and
	   multi-job execution.
	 o Clarify the part of the HBCI setup about potentially adding HBCI
	   accounts manually.
	 o Add a couple of extra checks to prevent crashing if the commodity
	   attached to a price quote has disappeared.
	 o Provide a new warning message before deletion if a commodity has
	   any price quotes.  If the user deletes the commodity anyway, removed
	   any quotes are based on the commodity
	 o Enhance the get prices routine to handle a request with a NULL
	   currency.
	 o Fix a crash where removing items in the wrong order could cause
	   "Bad Things" to happen
	 o Sort the bills before displaying them, so they appear in a
	   consistent order (by date due).
	 o Fix a bunch more rounding errors, and add more precision to the
	   price.
	 o Change the description and action of Invoice and Payement
	   Transactions/Splits, to make it easier to print a check off the
	   posted transactions.
	 o Add Debit and Credit totals to Register report.
	 o Differentiate between "file is already locked" and "we can't create
	   the lockfile" so we can let the user know.
	 o Fix the message to be more appropriate when we hit a READONLY
	   error.
	 o Various Postgres backend fixes
	 o Add button for manual adding of HBCI accounts. Requires latest
	   OpenHBCI 0.9.13
	 o Add saving of the HBCI_API so that bank's status changes will now
	   be remembered immediately.
	 o Add "(Report)" strings to the various columns displayed in the
	   report currency.
	 o Set the date-entered on invoice transactions to "now" instead of
	   the post date.  Thi lets us know when an invoice was actually posted,
	   or a payment was actually made.
	 o Support "gain/loss" balancing splits on stocks
	 o Apply patch to fix a number of off-by-one bugs in the loan druid.
	 o Adapted to latest gnucash-docs changes, by Jon Lapham
	 o Add code to read XML files with real namespace declarations.
	 o Make sure we define PWD, as not all shells define it properly.
	 o Workaround for multi-currency importing bug.
	 
 1.8.4  - 25 May 2003
 	 o Fix transfer dialog to nothang if OK button is clicked w/o filling
	   in dialog properly.
	 o Add HTML::Parser to the list of items checked/installed.
	 o Updated translations:  Brazilian Portugese, Czech, Italian, German
	 o Fix the "View xxxbar" menu items to track properly when a new data
	   file is opened. Consolidate the code for manipulating the
	   View/Statusbar and View/Summarybar menu items.  Work around a Gnome
	   MDI bug as best as possible.
	 o The numeric test regex was broken and would fail on ALL numerics,
	   causing all imports to be of value zero.
	 o Fix for creating new template transactions [from Scheduling
	   existing transactions], such that they have valid Posted dates.
	 o Fix for existing/old data without posted dates.  If we encounter
	   the condition, fixup the transaction's Posted date to that of the
	   Entered date.
	 o Add LOT_IS_CLOSED and LOT_BALANCE query parameter methods
	 o Fixes for 64-bit architectures.
	 o Add gncQueryGetBooks() API to return list of books in a query.
	 o Add INVOICE_POST_LOT query parameter methods
	 o Add an api to force an event even when events are suspended.
	   Without such an API, events can be lost if the event system is
	   suspended when the event comes in.
	 o Added gnucash wrappers around gnome-print's rotate, translate,
	   gsave, and grestore APIs.  All to allow sideways printing (by
	   rotating the image).
	 o Wrap the new print-session apis.
	 o Modify the AC_GWRAP_CHECK_GUILE() macro to take an argument, the
	   g-wrap module directory.  Then actually test that the g-wrap module
	   loads.  This should detect systems without slib installed.
	 o New gwrap check macro
	 o Deal properly when there are no prices for a commodity.
	 o Supply a start date (as well as an end date) and don't print
	   invoices that occur prior to the start date or after the end date.
	   The aging information ignores the start date, but not the end date.
	   This means the aging information will always be acurate through the
	   end date (even if all the invoices and payments are not displayed).
	 o Limit the itemized invoices/payments to the start/end date range,
	   but print out a "Balance" line if there is a non-zero balance as of
	   the start date.
	 o Nikos Charonitakis's account chart updates: added new carloan
	   account chart, updated account chart.
	 o Use the correct columns when printing the Gain column, don't reuse
	   the same column as profit; we want to report different values.
	 o Don't let the user do anything with the options dialog until
	   Apply() finishes.
	 o Had the wrong number of arguments in gnc:account-get-balance-at-date
	 o Add some (commented out) code to support a start date for computing
	   the Net Income (aka Net Profit) in the Balance Sheet.
	 o Move the instantiation of File -> Properties into main-window.scm
	   (out of business-gnome.scm) for future cases where we might decide to
	   ship the business modules separately.
	 o Fix the ofx test program to make sure it links on many weird
	   platforms.
	 o When we are asked to reload the report, queue the request, queue a
	   draw event, and then return immediately.  When the draw event
	   happens, load the report then.  This lets you hit Apply and then OK
	   before the report finishes loading.
	 o Make sure we can find libofx/libofx.h
	 o Include split transactions in the filtering of the transaction
	   report.
	 o Use a 'from' date to better compute the Net Income on the report.
	 o Change the default Search Operation for numerics from "less than"
	   to "equals" -- so by default you would search for an exact value.
	 o "eval" changed API on guile-1.6.  Use the existing API to convert a
	   delta symbol to a delta time.
	 o Call eval with the right number of arguments based on early or late
	   versions.
	 o Change the date format string to be consistent with other places
	   (e.g. the check print dialog) and use '%' instead of '~'.
	 o Make the Bill Due Days option selectable based on the setting of
	   Notify Bills Due?
	 o Don't crash if you remove the last entry and then add another one.
	 o Deal with the case where the first transaction found for a
	   particular company is a payment
	 o Also print out any overpayment in the total column.
	 o Catch errors when running the child reports so we display the
	   failed report backtrace but also display an error and continue with
	   the multicolumn report.
	 
 1.8.3  - 03 May 2003
 	 o Updated translations: Italian, Swedish, Danish, British,
	   Traditional Chinese, French, German, Tamil, Brazilian Portugese.
	 o Turn off the report-total by default
	 o The Euroland currency rates were inverted in the transfer dialog.
	 o Chris Morgan's Baysian Matching code, to match transactions based
	   on Bayesian filtering of previously matched transactions.
	 o Fix a bug in the account name list when you you filtered down to no
	   accounts it would ignore the filter.
	 o The Account Separator option was moved to the Accounts page,
	   reference correctly.
	 o Fix the keypress handlers so they work properly for both the text
	   entry widget and the calendar popup widget.
	 o Force the cursor to the first line of a transaction split before
	   disabling "double line" mode in the register.  This prevents the
	   register refresh code from trying to update a cell that is no longer
	   visible.
	 o Fix HBCI close-on-finished checkbutton.
	 o Add descriptions of new HBCI actions.
	 o OpenBSD fixes by Todd T. Fries
	 o New report "income vs. day of week" by Andy Wingo
	 o Fix a couple strings to improve comments when owners and accounts
	   are missing.  Direct the user to select them in the report options.
	 o When building the "name + address" string, check if the company
	   name and contact name are the same and, if so, only print one of
	   them.
	 o Fix the glade settings so resizing the window will properly resize
	   the widgets.
	 o Save the entry cells before adding an it to the invoice, otherwise
	   it wont get sorted properly.
	 o Add support in business code for the to-charge amount.
	 o Don't ask the user in the general case when making changes to
	   entries.  Generally the user should be allowed to make whatever
	   changes they want without being pestered.
	 o Guile-1.6 requires empty lists to be quoted.
	 o Symbols are not strings in guile-1.6.
	 o Fix "WeekDelta" and add TwoWeekDelta.
	 o Pop up a dialog if the user tries to transfer from a non-currency
	   account, and don't let them do it.
	 o Evaluate the date during get_predicate() in case the user just "hit
	   return" (and the auto-evaluate didn't happen).
	 o Fix crash during import of investment accounts.
	 o Fixes for GCC 3.3 warnings
	 o Fix HBCI user messages where chip cards were confused with key
	   files.
	 o Adapt to latest changes in OpenHBCI CVS.
	 o Applied Tomas Pospisek's patch to the transaction report.
	 o Fix the description of gnc:mdi-show-progress.
	 o Enable changing the "ID" for different business objects.
	 o Fix the percentage calculations so we don't get GtkCritical
	   warnings.
	 o Disable the test-scm-query-import test, since it breaks on
	   guile-1.6
	 o Move currency conversion to gnc-pricedb.c
	 o Improve report for stocks and funds not denominated in report
	   currency.
	 o QIF imports don't assume that a date of the form XXXXXXXX is always
	   YYYYMMDD. Make sure a 4-digit year "makes sense"
	 o Fix hbci and ofx test for handling --disable correctly.
	 o Fix openhbci macro again so that it uses a C check program.

	 o Many more fixes for the postgresql backend
	 o Fix the "bill reminder" so it doesn't create a query if there are
	   no payables accounts.
	 o Fix some of the accounts in the tree to be more accurate to the
	   real world.
	 o Only set ReadOnly status for Invoices, not Payments.
	 o Fix several bugs in QIF importer
	 o Recognize even more error codes from OpenHBCI.
	 o No longer assume that transaction with type OFX_OTHER are
	   investment transactions.
	 o Don't add income accounts to bills, or expense accounts to
	   invoices.  This should help further reduce user confusion with what
	   to do when entering invoices.
	 
 1.7.8  - 20 January 2003
 	 o Welcome to Release Canidate 3
	 o Fixed build issues introduced in last release
	 o Fix compile errors on SuSE 8.0 + 8.1
	 o Update translations, po/ru.po by Vitaly Lipatov, po/el.po by
	   ta_panta_rei@flashmail.com
	 o Ignore certain splits with an "amount" of zero.
	 o Convert from the old to new symbols for Russian Roubles.
	 o Invoices change a couple of columns.  Enable viewing the "taxable"
	   entry.  Enable viewing all the tax accounts individually.
	 o Scrub hbci include paths to prevent gcc 3.x compile errors.
	 o Default the OFX import directory to the directory of the last OFX
	   file imported, or the user's home dir for the first export.
	   Remembered across invocations of gnucash.
	 o Default the save directory to the directory of the last file used.
	   Default the exports directory to the directory of the last file
	   exported, or the user's home dir for the first export. Remembered
	   across invocations of gnucash.
	 o Correctly handle the case where no stocks have been defined and the
	   user asks gnucash to get price quotes.
	 o Work around bug in ghttp library so that intl users whose whole
	   units/fractions separator is a comma can request web pages.
	 o Add "Default Report Currency" preference.
	 o Set invoice currency based on owner's currency.
	 o Use invoice's currency for printing the invoice.
	 o Make the progress bar argument a double instead of an int.  This
	   gets around an issue with guile 1.6.
	 o Add a checkbox to search-for-all
	 o Changes to make the build system work on multiple architectures and
	   with multiple versions of the autotools suite.  Make generated g-wrap
	   sources depend on config.status.

	   dependant load path variable for the SRFI location. (Empty in 1.6
	   since they're bundled with guile.)

	   messages for unknown tags, or mismatched start/end tags.
	 o When checking for gtkhtml-1.1, make the lack of pkg-config a fatal
	   error. Also check for pkgconfig
	 o Updated translations, po/de.po, 
	 o Fix HBCI reparent warnings. Make the PIN dialog a bit nicer.
	 o Fixes to Postgresql backend.
	 o Changed the "ALTER TABLE table ADD COLUMN..." statements to conform
	   to the current Postgres implementation (and SQL 92) standard by
	   putting the DEFAULT modifier in a separate ALTER statement.  This was
	   reported by Christopher B. Browne.
	 o Implement unpost function in invoices.
	 o Correctly open a help window when the initial URL contains a label
	   component to it.
	 o Make the reconciliation window respect the 'include subaccount'
	   flag any time it opens a register.  Consolidate logic for opening a
	   new register. Enhance the reconciliation start window to update the
	   ending value when this flag is changed.
	 o If the amount is monetary, map the keypad decimal key to the
	   correct decimal character for the locale.
	 o Fix malformed URLs for bringing up a report options window.

	   If there are any files loaded it returns to the "loaded files" page
	   instead of the initial druid page.
	 o Add support for i18n of price source strings.
	 o Add icons to gtk only windows.
	 o Search on NOTES add code to prevent searching on template-txn
	   accounts so SXes don't show up in find results.
	 o Create a 'file compression' option and pass the data into the
	   backend. This is an option in the preferences.
	 o Provide a simple checkbook set of accounts
	 o When editing an exchange rate, always change the _VALUE_ of the
	   split, not the amount.  This has the affect of keeping the visible
	   number the same and changing the "other" account.
	 o Add a set of business accounts to the account setup
	 o Give a much higher importance to the date heuristics in the OFX
	   import. 
	 o Disable skipping transactions which already have an online id
	   during matching, untill a fix for the "transfer between two accounts"
	   bug is properly fixed.
	 o Large set of fixes to the build system by John H. Pierce
	   <john@killterm.org>

 1.7.6  - 22 December 2002
 	 o Welcome to Release Candidate 1
	 o Put the build date into the about box for development versions
	 o Deal with broken QIF files that give broken bang-fields. In
	   particular, handle the case where it supplies "!Type Bank"
	   instead of "!Type:Bank"
	 o Fix g-wrap test to fail properly if it cannot find g-wrap-config
	 o Add "Edit Exchange Rate" menu items to the Actions menu and the
	   context menu
	 o Fix the amount display so that the exchange dialog always shows the
	   "amount" in the the local (register) currency.
	 o Add an additional module to check for (LWP aka libwww-perl)
	   before attempting to call Finance::Quote.
	 o Updated translations, po/nl.po by Hendrik-Jan Heins <hjh@passys.nl>,
	   po/uk.po by Volodymyr M. Lisivka <lvm@mystery.lviv.net>, po/el.po,

	   place. Functions to record whether or not F::Q is installed
	   properly, and if so, whether a particular source is available.
	 o Change default new SX frequency to monthly
	 o Filled in a long-thought of idea for a formula cell: can contain
	   text unlike a pricecell, but doesn't really want to do
	   auto-complete like a quickfill cell [what we had been using].  This
	   allows us to provide the gnome formula cell which can remap the
	   keypad '.' character based on locale
	 o Disallow the deletion of accounts with ReadOnly Transacation in
	   them. You must first "delete" the RO Txns before you delete the
	   account.

	 o Catch the condition gracefully when OpenHBCI config file does not
	   exist.
	 o Compute the implicit exchange rates for ALL transactions when

	   transaction, and Income transactions which will directly create 
	   a income account -> cash account transaction. Support memorising 
	   the income account association. Several stock account can use the 
	   same income account if desired.

            Many versin 1.0 ledger functions missing.
            Splits added to engine.

 1.0.11 - 11 Dec 97
         o large variety of bug fixes, patches, enhancements.

 1.0b1 - 29 Nov 97
         o  Many, many changes by Linas Vepstas to give double entry
            bookkeeping, sub-accounts, income/expense account types, and
            the beginnings of support for the QIF data format.
         o  All "non-standard" libraries needed for xacc (xbae, libhtmlw,
            and libComboBox) are now part of the xacc distribution, to
            make it easier to build xacc.
         o  Applied XbaeMatrixSetCursorPosition patch (needed for quickfill)
            to Linas's modified xbae src.  (So quickfill works again.)
         o  configure script to make it easier to build xacc.
         o  The environment variable XACC_HELP will tell xacc where to
            find the files for the hypertext help.  If XACC_HELP isn't
            set, xacc will default to "./Docs" as the help path.

 0.9 - 08 Sep 97
         o  Lots of code-cleanup.
         o  Adjust Balance window.
         o  Reconcile window!  Makes it easy to reconcile your account
            at the end of the month when you get your new bank statement.
         o  Hypertext, context sensitive help.  A pretty nice add-on,
            thanks to libhtmlw, from NCSA Mosaic.  (Now someone just
            has to write some decent help pages!)
         o  Fixed busy cursor.  Previously the code the switched cursors
            caused the program to crash, so it wasn't enabled.  Now it
            works, and is enabled.

 0.7 - 14 Jul 97
         o  Started adding support for account types other than "BANK".
            Still no support for Portfolio and Mutual accounts.  (They
            are greyed out in the "New Account" window for now.)
         o  Changed the balance field to use red/black text to denote
            negative/positive balance (instead of using a sign... If you
            define USE_NO_COLOR when compiling, it will revert to the
            old method of displaying a '-' in front of negative balances)
         o  Fixed bug in automatic transfers that cause the "From"
            account to always be the first account, and the "To" account
            to possibly be incorrect.  Also, added "[To: ]" "[From: ]"
            (with to account name, and from account name) to the start
            of the memo field, so you can keep track of where the money
            comes from/goes to.

 0.6 - 28 Jun 97
         o  Fixed balance/reconciled field (in bottom right corner
            of register window.  (It sorta works now, with lesstif.
            I don't know about motif... you have to leave the current
            transaction for the balances to be recalculated.)
         o  Rearranged directory structure... the source was growing
            to too many files to have it all in one directory.

 0.5 - 6 Jun 97    Mostly, minor bug fixes
         o  verifyDate  -- affects when accelerator keys in the
            register window cause the date to cross a year boundary
         o  Fixed handling of the date in the transfer window.  Before
            if the user pressed the "transfer" button with an incomplete
            date in the date field, the resulting date would be
            undefined.
         o  If the user doesn't enter data in the description field,
            The number field, the memo field, or one of the amount
            fields, the the new transaction isn't added when the
            user leaves the new transaction, or presses "Record"
         o  Now user is prevented from entering more than one '.'
            in the amount fields in the register and transfer windows.
            Also, the user is prevented from entering more than two
            '/' in the date field in the transfer window.
         o  Fixed a (very small) memory leak in the transfer window.
         o  Fixed a bug in the transfer window that resulted in a
            different amount subtracted from the "from" account as was
            added to the "to" account.
         o  Fixed bug that caused a segfault when deleting the last
            transaction in the register window.
         o  Now if the user is in the last transaction (the empty
            transaction) in the register window, the "Delete" button
            does not do anything.
 
 0.4 - 3 Jun 97
         o  Added "Balance" and "Reconciled" balance to the bottom
            right corner of the register window.  
         o  The main window uses an Xbae-Matrix widget now, instead
            of a list, in order to line up the account names, types,
            and balances in nice columns.
	
 0.2 - First (mostly) functional release.  Most of the buttons,
       and menu bar choices actually do something now.

 0.1 - First demo release.  Lots of buttons, and menu bar choices
       Don't do anything.  The register window is still pretty
       buggy.
