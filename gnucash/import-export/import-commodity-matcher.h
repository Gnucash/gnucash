/**
  Must be called with a string containing a unique identifier for the
  commodity.  If an commodity with a matching cusip is found, the
  function immediately returns with a pointer to that commodity.
  Otherwise, the user may be prompted to select a GnuCash commodity or
  create a new one (in both cases, the cusip is written to the
  commodity's cusip field, overwriting anything that was there before.

  @param cusip The string containing the code for which you want a
  matching commodity.  A CUISP code or similar UNIQUE code.  The stock
  ticker is NOT appropriate, unless you have no other option. Must be
  non-NULL.

  @param ask_on_unknown If the cusip value is unknown and this parameter
  is false (zero), the function returns NULL. Otherwise the user will
  be asked to select an existing or create a new commodity.

  @param default_fullname A human-readable description of the
  commodity, such as the stock name.  Can be NULL. If it is not NULL,
  it will be shown to the user when selecting a commodity.  It will
  also be used as the default if a new commodity is created.

  @param default_mnemonic Usually the stock ticker or similar. Can be
  NULL.  If it is not NULL, it will be shown to the user when
  selecting a commodity.  It will also be used as the default if a new
  commodity is created.

  @return A pointer to the found or created commodity, or NULL if no
  commodity was found or created.
