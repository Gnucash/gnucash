/** @name Lot Management Routines
 * Provides the low-level API for checking and repairing ('scrubbing
 * clean') the usage of Lots and lot balances in stock and commodity
 * accounts.  Broken lots are repaired using a first-in, first-out
 * (FIFO) accounting schedule.
 *
 * This is a 'low-level' API in the sense that each routine accomplishes
 * only one particular task needed to clean up a Lot.  To clean up a
 * Lot as a whole, you almost certainly want to use one of the
 * high-level API routines from the Scrub3.h file.

/** The xaccAccountAssignLots() routine will walk over all of
 *   the splits in an account, and make sure that each belongs
 *   to a lot.  Currently, the default (and only implemented)
 *   assignment policy is a FIFO policy: Any splits that are
 *   not in a lot will be used to close the oldest open lot(s).
 *   If there are no open lots, a new lot will be started.
 *   By trying to close the oldest lots, this effectively
 *   implements a FIFO accounting policy.

 *   By 'double balance', we mean that both the sum of the
 *   split amounts is zero, and that the sum of the split
 *   values is zero.  If the lot is closed and the sum of the
 *   values is not zero, the lot is considered to have a
 *   'realized gain or loss' that hadn't been correctly handled.
 *   This routine then creates a balancing transaction to so
 *   as to record the realized gain/loss, adds it to the lot,
 *   and adds it to a gain/loss account.  If there is no default

 *    lots; they can be merged back together if the lots change.
 *    In particular, two sub-splits may be merged if they are in
 *    the same lot, or in no lot.  Note that, by definition, all
 *    subsplits belong to the same transaction.
 *
 *    There are two ways to find matching subsplits. The first
 *    way will consider splits to be subsplits only if they
 *    are explicitly marked as such while splitting the original
 *    split. Set strict to TRUE for this matching algorithm.
 *
 *    The second way is more relaxed. It will consider any two
 *    splits that happen to be part of the same lot and the
 *    same transaction to be subsplits. Set strict to FALSE for
 *    this matching algorithm.
 *
 *    The routine returns TRUE if a merger was performed, else
 *    it returns FALSE.
