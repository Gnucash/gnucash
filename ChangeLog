	* Make it possible to post multiple invoices from the find dialog. GnuCash was crashing if you searched for all unposted invoices, selected two or more of them, and posted them.  This was because the list of invoices to be posted changed while it was being processed.  As part of fixing this the prompt for post date, due date, etc. will only be given once, not once per invoice.

This update changes adds the print check, find transactions, schedule transactions and reconcile options to the new register. This was done by copying the existing files and changing them to work with the new register so both new and old could work at the same time. The new find option on the accounts page has been commented out so the old one would work but has been proved to work the same as on the new registers.

	* Prevent line break in date column on hyphen.

2013-03-24 Mike Alexander

2013-03-23 Mike Alexander 

	* One more try to get initialization right. This doesn't change things unless --add-price-quotes is given.  If it is then it must be handled before gtk is initialized since DISPLAY might not be set which will cause gtk initialization to fail.  This happens when running the X version of GnuCash from launchd on a Mac to get price quotes updated.

	* Bug 683881 Partial implementation.

2013-02-06 Mike Alexander 

	* Avoid a crash when entering invalid dates (e.g., enter "111" for a transaction date). gnc_parse_date is ignoring the return code from qof_scan_date which causes it to send uninitialized values to gnc_mktime which crashes if the date is too ridiculous. Presumably this worked before because mktime took anything without crashing.

2013-02-05 J. Alex Aycinena

2013-01-30 Mike Alexander 

	* Do a better job of prompting for an exchange rate only when needed. If the debit or credit value of a split changes, prompt for an exchange rate. Don't prompt for an exchange rate in a register that doesn't have a rate cell (and fix a bug so that it knows that portfolio registers don't have one). If the transaction has been autofilled and edited start with a nearby rate from the prices DB.  If it is an existing transaction start with the exchange rate it already has.
