/** @addtogroup GSettings GSettings Utilities

    The API in this file is designed to make it easy to use the GSettings
    system from within Gnucash.  GSettings is a shared key/value storage
    system.

    The main benefits of these routines are that they
    -# maintain a list of GSettings objects (one per schema),
    -# convert gnucash internal schema names into full gsettings schema id's, and
    -# optionally take care of error checking on return values.

    Note that this api should not be called directly. Instead use
    the gnc_gsettings_load_backend function to configure gsettings
    as backend for the gnucash preferences api and then use
    the gnc_prefs_* functions instead to work with preferences.
