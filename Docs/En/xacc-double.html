    <title>Understanding Double Entry Accounting</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h2>What is Double Entry Accounting?</h2>

    <p> Double entry is an accounting methodology used by
    professional accountants to make sure that all accounts and
    indeed <em> each transaction</em> is properly balanced. When
    these are all required to balance, the likelihood of data-entry
    errors is greatly reduced. For large, complex sets of accounts
    with many transactions, it is distressingly easy to make errors
    that may go undetected for a long time. Double-entry is a
    crucial technology that has been used since the 13th century to
    avoid such errors.</p>

    <p> A double-entry transaction is a transaction that contains
    entries for two (or more) accounts that balance against one
    another. One account is <em>debited</em> by an amount exactly
    equal to what the other is <em>credited.</em> By ensuring that
    each transaction balances, a balanced set of accounts is
    guaranteed. This doesn't prevent you from having errors, but
    certainly eliminates the large class of <b> I forgot to enter
    that part of the transaction</b> errors.</p>

    <p> Double-entry may be introduced in a more intuitive way via
    the notion of a transfer from one bank account to another,
    where an amount is taken out of one bank account and deposited
    in the other. This is effectively the "rule" of double entry
    accounting; if you add something in to one account, you <em>
    have</em> to have another component to that transaction to
    balance this.</p>

    <p> <b> Not-quite-an-aside:</b> If you look at your bank
    statements, they are typically written up from the <b>
    bank's</b> perspective, which is exactly <em> opposite</em> to
    yours. For instance, when you put money in, establishing a
    deposit, this establishes a <b> DEBT</b> on their part.</p>

    <p> The perhaps less obvious extension is the notion that
    double entry can be used to represent income and expenses as
    well as bank transfers. See the <a href="xacc-expense.html">
    Income/Expense</a> page for more information.</p>

    <p> <a name="IDENTITY"> In a traditional system that records
    debits and credits separately, the identity that all
    transactions are required to satisfy is that <tt> Total of
    Debits = Total of Credits.</tt></a></p>

    <p> X-Accountant treats "Debits" as positive values, and
    "Credits" as negative values, so that this identity simplifies
    to <tt> value<sub>1</sub> + value<sub>2</sub> +
    value<sub>3</sub> + ... = 0</tt></p>

    <h2>Using Double Entry</h2>

    <p> To use the double entry system, click on a box in the
    column marked "Transfer From" on the left-hand side of the
    register. A menu will drop down, listing all of the accounts
    from which a transfer may be made. Select one. When you record
    the transaction, the double-entry will automatically be made,
    and the transaction automatically appear in all windows showing
    the transfered-from and the transferred-to accounts.</p>

    <p> To <em> change</em> a double-entry transaction, edit the
    transaction in any window in which it appears. Any changes made
    will be automatically reflected in both accounts and all
    windows displaying the transaction. Similarly, when a
    double-entry transaction is deleted, it will be deleted from
    both accounts; balances are automatically recalculated for <em>
    both</em> accounts.</p>

    <p> To change the transfer account, simply select a new account
    from the pull-down menu. When you record the transaction, it
    will automatically be selected from the old account, and
    inserted into the new account.</p>

    <h2>Scrubbing Clean</h2>

    <p> GnuCash can be configured to be strict about double entry,
    or you may configure it to be "loose."</p>

    <p> In "loose" mode, you can create <em>unbalanced
    transactions,</em> that is, transactions where the "splits"
    don't balance to zero. That discards the validation that comes
    from using the more strict double entry scheme, which is
    probably not a really wise move. In effect:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>If you aren't sure of what you're doing, you likely do
      not want to discard the validation of <b> double entry,</b>
      as this helps you keep your accounts balanced even when
      you're not perfectly clear on this.</li>

      <li>If you are an <em> accounting whiz,</em> you'll know that
      it's <em> really important</em> to keep things in balance,
      and again will prefer <b> double entry.</b></li>
    </ul>

    <p> But if you decide to "outsmart the system," and have a
    number of unbalanced transactions, you'll probably want to
    clean this up at some point. To clean up these unbalanced
    transactions, you <b> Scrub</b> the account clean by choosing
    <tt>Scrub</tt> from the window menu. This will examine each
    transaction; if the transaction doesn't balance, a split entry
    will be created and placed into an account named <b>
    Unbalanced.</b> You may then review these splits and move them
    to their proper accounts.</p>
