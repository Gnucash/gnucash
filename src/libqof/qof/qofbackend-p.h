/**
 * The backend_new routine sets the functions that will be used
 *    by the backend to perform the actions required by QOF. A
 *    basic minimum is session_begin, session_end, load and
 *    sync. Any unused functions should be set to NULL. If the
 *    backend uses configuration options, backend_new must ensure
 *    that these are set to usable defaults before returning. To use
 *    configuration options, load_config and get_config must also
 *    be defined.
 *
 * The session_begin() routine gives the backend a second initialization
 *    opportunity.  It is suggested that the backend check that
 *    the URL is syntactically correct, and that it is actually
 *    reachable.  This is probably(?) a good time to initialize
 *    the actual network connection.
 *
 *    The 'ignore_lock' argument indicates whether the single-user
 *    lock on the backend should be cleared.  The typical GUI sequence
 *    leading to this is: (1) GUI attempts to open the backend
 *    by calling this routine with FALSE==ignore_lock.  (2) If backend
 *    error'ed BACKEND_LOCK, then GUI asks user what to do. (3) if user
 *    answers 'break & enter' then this routine is called again with
 *    TRUE==ignore_lock.
 *
 *    The 'create_if_nonexistent' argument indicates whether this
 *    routine should create a new 'database', if it doesn't already
 *    exist. For example, for a file-backend, this would create the
 *    file, if it didn't already exist.  For an SQL backend, this
 *    would create the database (the schema) if it didn't already
 *    exist.  This flag is used to implement the 'SaveAs' GUI, where
 *    the user requests to save data to a new backend.
 *
 * The load() routine should load the minimal set of application data
 *    needed for the application to be operable at initial startup.
 *    It is assumed that the application will perform a 'run_query()'
 *    to obtain any additional data that it needs.  For file-based
 *    backends, it is acceptable for the backend to return all data
 *    at load time; for SQL-based backends, it is acceptable for the
 *    backend to return no data.
 *
 *    Thus, for example, the GnuCash postgres backend returned
 *    the account tree, all currencies, and the pricedb, as these
 *    were needed at startup.  It did not have to return any
 *    transactions whatsoever, as these were obtained at a later stage
 *    when a user opened a register, resulting in a query being sent to
 *    the backend.
 *
 *    (Its OK to send over entities at this point, but one should
 *    be careful of the network load; also, its possible that whatever
 *    is sent is not what the user wanted anyway, which is why its
 *    better to wait for the query).
 *
 * The begin() routine is called when the engine is about to
 *    make a change to a data structure. It can provide an advisory
 *    lock on data.
 *
 * The commit() routine commits the changes from the engine to the
 *    backend data storage.
 *
 * The rollback() routine is used to revert changes in the engine
 *    and unlock the backend.
 *
 *    If the second user tries to modify an entity that
 *    the first user deleted, then the backend should set the error
 *    to ERR_BACKEND_MOD_DESTROY from this routine, so that the
 *    engine can properly clean up.
 *
 * The compile_query() method compiles a QOF query object into
 *    a backend-specific data structure and returns the compiled
 *    query. For an SQL backend, the contents of the query object
 *    need to be turned into a corresponding SQL query statement, and
 *    sent to the database for evaluation.
 *
 * The free_query() method frees the data structure returned from
 *    compile_query()
 *
 * The run_query() callback takes a compiled query (generated by
 *    compile_query) and runs the query in across the backend,
 *    inserting the responses into the engine. The database will
 *    return a set of splits and transactions and this callback needs
 *    to poke these into the account-group hierarchy held by the query
 *    object.
 *
 *    For a network-communications backend, essentially the same is
 *    done, except that this routine would convert the query to wire
 *    protocol, get an answer from the remote server, and push that
 *    into the account-group object.
 *
 *    The returned list of entities can be used to build a local
 *    cache of the matching data.  This will allow the QOF client to
 *    continue functioning even when disconnected from the server:
 *    this is because it will have its local cache of data from which to work.
 *
 * The sync() routine synchronizes the engine contents to the backend.
 *    This should done by using version numbers (hack alert -- the engine
 *    does not currently contain version numbers).
 *    If the engine contents are newer than what is in the backend, the
 *    data is stored to the backend. If the engine contents are older,
 *    then the engine contents are updated.
 *
 *    Note that this sync operation is only meant to apply to the
 *    current contents of the engine. This routine is not intended
 *    to be used to fetch entity data from the backend.
 *
 *    File based backends tend to use sync as if it was called dump.
 *    Data is written out into the backend, overwriting the previous
 *    data. Database backends should implement a more intelligent
 *    solution.
 *
 * The events_pending() routines should return true if there are
 *    external events which need to be processed to bring the
 *    engine up to date with the backend.
 *
 * The process_events() routine should process any events indicated
 *    by the events_pending() routine. It should return TRUE if
 *    the engine was changed while engine events were suspended.
 *
 * The last_err member indicates the last error that occurred.
 *    It should probably be implemented as an array (actually,
 *    a stack) of all the errors that have occurred.
 *
 * For support of book partitioning, use special "Book"  begin_edit()
 *    and commit_edit() QOF_ID types.
 *
 *    Call the book begin() at the begining of a book partitioning.  A
 *    'partitioning' is the splitting off of a chunk of the current
 *    book into a second book by means of a query.  Every transaction
 *    in that query is to be moved ('transfered') to the second book
 *    from the existing book.  The argument of this routine is a
 *    pointer to the second book, where the results of the query
 *    should go.
 *
 *    Call the book commit() to complete the book partitioning.
 *
 *    After the begin(), there will be a call to run_query(), followed
 *    probably by a string of object calls, and completed by commit().
 *    It should be explicitly understood that the results of that
 *    run_query() precisely constitute the set of objects that are to
 *    be moved between the initial and the new book. This specification
 *    can be used by a clever backend to avoid excess data movement
 *    between the server and the QOF client, as explained below.
 *
 *    There are several possible ways in which a backend may choose to
 *    implement the book splitting process.  A 'file-type' backend may
 *    choose to ignore this call, and the subsequent query, and simply
 *    write out the new book to a file when the commit() call is made.
 *    By that point, the engine will have performed all of the
 *    nitty-gritty of moving transactions from one book to the other.
 *
 *    A 'database-type' backend has several interesting choices.  One
 *    simple choice is to simply perform the run_query() as it
 *    normally would, and likewise treat the object edits as usual.
 *    In this scenario, the commit() is more or less a no-op.
 *    This implementation has a drawback, however: the run_query() may
 *    cause the transfer of a <b>huge</b> amount of data between the backend
 *    and the engine.  For a large dataset, this is quite undesirable.
 *    In addition, there are risks associated with the loss of network
 *    connectivity during the transfer; thus a partition might terminate
 *    half-finished, in some indeterminate state, due to network errors.
 *    It might be difficult to recover from such errors: the engine does
 *    not take any special safety measures during the transfer.
 *
 *    Thus, for a large database, an alternate implementation
 *    might be to use the run_query() call as an opportunity to
 *    transfer entities between the two books in the database,
 *    and not actually return any new data to the engine.  In
 *    this scenario, the engine will attempt to transfer those
 *    entities that it does know about.  It does not, however,
 *    need to know about all the other entities that also would
 *    be transfered over.  In this way, a backend could perform
 *    a mass transfer of entities between books without having
 *    to actually move much (or any) data to the engine.
 *
 * To support configuration options from the frontend, the backend
 *    can be passed a KvpFrame - according to the allowed options
 *    for that backend, using load_config(). Configuration can be
 *    updated at any point - it is up to the frontend to load the
 *    data in time for whatever the backend needs to do. e.g. an
 *    option to save a new book in a compressed format need not be
 *    loaded until the backend is about to save. If the configuration
 *    is updated by the user, the frontend should call load_config
 *    again to update the backend.
 *
 *    Backends are responsible for ensuring that any supported
 *    configuration options are initialised to usable values.
 *    This should be done in the function called from backend_new.
