/** @addtogroup PriceDB  Price Database
    @ingroup Engine
    The PriceDB is intended to be a database of price quotes, or more
    specifically, a database of GNCPrices.  For the time being, it is
    still a fairly simple database supporting only fairly simple
    queries.  It is expected that new queries will be added as needed,
    and that there is some advantage to delaying complex queries for
    now in the hope that we get a real DB implementation before
    they're really needed.

    Every QofBook contains a GNCPriceDB, accessible via
    gnc_pricedb_get_db.

    \warning The PriceDB does not currently use the object
    system used elsewhere in the GnuCash Engine, i.e. it does
    not use GUISD's, Entities and Collections.  It should.
    In particular, this means that currently prices cannot
    be queried with the same mechanism as everything else.
*/

/** @addtogroup Price  Prices
    @ingroup Engine
    Each price in the database represents an "instantaneous" quote for
    a given commodity with respect to another commodity.  For example,
    a given price might represent the value of LNUX in USD on
    2001-02-03.

    \par Fields:

    - commodity: the item being priced.
    - currency: the denomination of the value of the item being priced.
    - value: the value of the item being priced.
    - time: the time the price was valid.
    - source: a string describing the source of the quote.  These
      strings will be something like this: "Finance::Quote",
      "user:misc", "user:foo", etc.  If the quote came from a user,
      as a matter of policy, you *must* prefix the string you give
      with "user:".  For now, the only other reserved values are
      "Finance::Quote" and "old-file-import".  Any string used must
      be added to the source_list array in dialog-price-edit-db.c so
      that it can be properly translated. (There are unfortunately
      many strings in users' databases, so this string must be
      translated on output instead of always being used in untranslated
      form).
    - type: the type of quote - types possible right now are bid, ask, last,
      nav, transaction, and unknown. 'Transaction' is set when the price is
      created from an amount and value in a Split and is not available for users
      to set via the GUI.

    \par Implementation Details:

    \note
    For source and type, NULL and the empty string are
    considered the same, so if one of these is "", then after a file
    save/restore, it might be NULL.  Behave accordingly.

    GNCPrices are reference counted.  When you gnc_price_create one
    or clone it, the new price's count is set to 1.  When you are
    finished with a price, call gnc_price_unref.  If you hand the
    price pointer to some other code that needs to keep it, make
    sure it calls gnc_price_ref to indicate its interest in that
    price, and calls gnc_price_unref when it's finished with the
    price.  For those unfamiliar with reference counting, basically
    each price stores an integer count which starts at 1 and is
    incremented every time someone calls gnc_price_ref.  Conversely,
    the count is decremented every time someone calls
    gnc_price_unref.  If the count ever reaches 0, the price is
    destroyed.

      All of the getters return data that's internal to the GNCPrice,
      not copies, so don't free these values.

      All of the setters store copies of the data given, with the
      exception of the commodity field which just stores the pointer
      given.  It is assumed that commodities are a global resource and
      are pointer unique.
