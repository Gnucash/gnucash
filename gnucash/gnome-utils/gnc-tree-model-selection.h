/*
 * This file creates a GtkTreeModel that extends an existing
 * GtkTreeModel by a single column.  This new column holds a single
 * boolean value per row.
 *
 * GtkTreeViews allow the creation of columns in any order, not just
 * the order they appear in the underlying model.  The most likely use
 * of this code will have the first view column mapped to this extra
 * boolean model column, and the column value diaplayed by a checkbox.
