Some Thoughts about GnuCash Budgeting

Bob Drzyzgula

Abstract

At this point, this document contains my personal thoughts about possible
design criteria for a budgeting engine in GnuCash. These should not
at this writing be taken as concensus opinion, and may in places be
at odds with conventions inside GnuCash code (and with general accounting
principals... I am in no way an accountant), and thus may not be practical.
However, I believe that they provide a self-consistant view of how
one might do this, and I hope that this document will serve to continue
the discussion that began on the GnuCash/Xacc mailing list.

1 Definitions

As with any design paper, we'll need a few definitions. I'll try to
stick as close to possible to the Xacc usage of these terms, but I'm
not intimately familiar with the code, so I may have made some errors
here. 

Journal A journal is a simply a list of transactions with minimal
  characterization. For the purposes of this paper, the journal is
  defined to include only transactions that have already occurred,
  i.e., expected or up-coming expenses would not appear in the journal.

Calendar For the purposes of this paper, the calendar as a list of
  fully-defined future transactions, organized by date. A transaction
  would only appear in the calendar if there was a low likelihood
  that it would change. Future transactions that would only change
  by surprise (e.g. the cable TV bill) could appear in the calendar,
  but utility bills such as from the natural gas company would appear
  in the calendar only after receipt.

Template A template is in effect a partially defined transaction,
  possibly containing constraints. For example, one might have a template
  that would identify the price, payee, description, asset account
  and expense account (but not the date) for buying a Value Meal #4
  at the corner McDonald's, so every time you get the Value Meal #4
  you could pull it out of a GUI pick list and just specify the date.
  Alternatively, one could have a template that specified much of
  the data for the natural gas bill but not the amount, so that (a)
  entering the transaction when the bill came could be simplified,
  and (b) the partial information could be recorded, in effect as
  a reminder. A template could include such information as a confidence
  interval, so that, for example, if you and your family go out to
  dinner every Friday night and it usually costs $20-50, you could
  create a template that had $35 +/- $15 as the amount. Such templates
  could be extremely useful in making projections. Quicken, of course,
  has similar things called ``memorized transactions,'' but Quicken
  gives less control over their creation, meaning and use.

Schedule The schedule is a supplement to the calendar that contains
  only dated references to templates, which could be further narrowed
  as part of the reference, e.g. an undated template could be given
  a date but not a firm value when referenced from the schedule.

Ledger The ledger is in effect documentation of the journal, in that
  it describes the meaning of the transactions with respect to the
  balances in the various accounts. In Xacc, this appears also to
  be known as the register. It isn't clear to me that Xacc maintans
  the journal and the ledger separately. The ledger could easily be
  expanded to include documentation of the calendar transactions,
  but it is less clear that one would want to include the template
  references from the schedule directly in the ledger; it may make
  more sense for the schedule to be a ledger unto itself.

Budget A budget is an allocation of monetary flows. As funds enter
  the system through the income accounts, they must be transferred
  to other accounts; a direct deposit would be a transfer to an asset
  account, a loan payment through payroll deduction a transfer to
  a liability account, and tax withholding a transfer to an expense
  account. Of course, secondary transfers - check payments to credit
  card accounts, for example - are expected. The budget must cover
  a certain time period; one year is typical but not necessary. Typically
  one begins with the expected income over the budget period and describes
  what is expected to become of the money. In addition, it is typically
  the case that one will begin a budget period with initial assets
  and liabilities, that assets may be transferred to expense and liability
  accounts, and that new liabilities may be created as a way to obtain
  additional assets or cover expenses. It is not necessary and is
  in fact (in my view) undesirable for the budget to make specific
  reference to any transactions or templates; it is not even necessary
  to describe the precise path of the funds through accounts. Thus,
  while the budget documents one's goals for where the funds wind
  up, the schedule, calendar, journal and ledger describe the actual
  mechanics of the process. Finally, it should be noted that, in addition
  to describing the endpoints of the budget period, one typically
  will set a certain checkpoint frequency in the budget so that (a)
  the time dependence of the various flows is more obvious, and (b)
  one can conduct periodic verification of the accounts' status with
  respect to the budget. Most often this checkpoint frequency is either
  monthly or per-four-weeks. The former might be referred to as ``budgeting
  on a monthly basis.''

2 Documenting the Budget

One possible way to document a budget might be as a classic ``input-ouput
table''. Consider the following table:

+---------+----------+---------+-----+------+------+-----+------+------+
|         | Checking | Savings | MMA | Cash | Visa | Tax | Food | Rent |
+---------+----------+---------+-----+------+------+-----+------+------+
+---------+----------+---------+-----+------+------+-----+------+------+
|Checking |    x     |    3    |  2  |  7   |  3   |     |      |  5   |
+---------+----------+---------+-----+------+------+-----+------+------+
|Savings  |          |    x    |  1  |      |      |     |      |      |
+---------+----------+---------+-----+------+------+-----+------+------+
|  MMA    |          |         |  x  |      |      |     |      |      |
+---------+----------+---------+-----+------+------+-----+------+------+
|  Cash   |          |         |     |  x   |      |     |  6   |      |
+---------+----------+---------+-----+------+------+-----+------+------+
|  Visa   |          |         |     |  8   |  x   |     |  7   |      |
+---------+----------+---------+-----+------+------+-----+------+------+
|Paycheck |    20    |         |     |      |      |  5  |      |      |
+---------+----------+---------+-----+------+------+-----+------+------+
|Interest |          |    2    |  3  |      |      |     |      |      |
+---------+----------+---------+-----+------+------+-----+------+------+


The first five data columns and the first five data rows have the same
names. These are the asset and liability accounts. The last three
columns are the expense accounts, and the last two rows are the income
accounts (When I learn a little more SGML I'll try to make the table
a little more readable). Notice:

* If you sum across the income rows, you obtain the total income for
  each account: $25 from paychecks and $5 from interest, for a total
  of $30. If you sum down the expense rows, you obtain the total expenses
  for each account: $5 for taxes, $13 for food, and $5 for rent (OK,
  so we eat a lot). Just looking at these two figures, we can immediately
  see that we expect to make $30 and spend $23 of it.

* The sense of each amount is positive from the row account to the
  column account. Thus, $20 of pay is direct-deposited to the checking
  account, and the remaining $5 is withheld for taxes. $1 is transferred
  from the savings account to the money market account. We plan to
  use the Visa card to buy $7 worth of food and to take a $8 cash
  advance. We also plan to pay Visa bills totalling $3 from the checking
  account.

* If you sum down an asset/liability column, you will obtain the total
  amount we expect to add to that account (e.g. $6 added to the MMA,
  $20 added to checking, $3 to Visa). If you sum across an asset/liability
  row, you will obtain the total amount we expect to remove from that
  account (e.g. none from the MMA, $20 from checking, $15 from Visa).
  Thus, if you subtract the row sum from the column sum for a single
  asset or liability account, you may obtain the planned net change
  in that account for the budget period. Thus, we expect checking
  to be a wash, the MMA to grow by $6, and to go $12 further in the
  hole on our Visa card.

* Again, what is documented here is the planned account-to-account
  flow across the entire period, not individual transactions.

3 Contributing Data

(to be done)
================================================================


Where I'm headed for the rest of it is this:

 * I expect to point out that the Journal, Calendar and
 Ledger as I have described them are only tangentially
 related to the budget. They are the emperical data and
 the Budget and the Schedule are the models. The goal
 would be to have an engine that would allow one to
 measure the deviation of the emperical data from 
 the model in various ways.

 * I expect to talk about the task of generating both
 the schedule and the budget. When one prepares this
 stuff, one usually has a rather diverse collection of
 data to work with. Bi-weekly paychecks, monthly
 interest income, quarterly dividends, five-day-per-week
 lunch charges, etc. What I would very much like to do
 is describe a mechanism whereby one could simply enter
 all these kinds of data into the engine, and it will
 digest it all into the budget and/or schedule formats.
 I expect to do this by preparing projected transactions
 as "templates", and then specifying a time series of
 instantiations of the templates.

 * I expect to describe a design for a sort of OO
 time series engine, where "time series" is a class.
 Instances of "time series" will have begin dates,
 end dates, frequencies, and the data series itself.
 Time series arithmetic will be defined, and these may
 entail frequency conversions to force the operand series
 to commensurate frequencies before combination.  Thus,
 explicit conversion functions, say "monthly_to_daily"
 will need to be defined.

 * Once these pieces are in place, then one should be
 able to use the time series engine to digest the
 scraps of paper with scribbles saying "Katie's lunch,
 $2.30 every Monday through Thursday except only
 $0.40 on Friday because they have burritos on
 Friday and she hates them and brings her lunch but
 still needs milk" into something usable as a
 budget -or- as a schedule (these being two seperate
 outputs).

 * While I expect that such an engine would be extremely
 useful for about 80% of the data that would go into
 a budget, there will of course be other data for which
 this would be overkill or cumbersome. Like "$85 each
 February and October for spraying the hemlocks with
 dormant oil". I can't imagine that anyone would rather
 make up some bogus time series for this than to open
 up a spreadsheet and type in two numbers, or even
 add a couple of records to an input data file. Thus, there
 should be some mechanism for this, where hand-entered
 data can be merged into the final budget or schedule.
 it should not, however, be implemented as hand edits to the
 draft table coming out of the time series engine,
 because one will want to be able to iterate on this.
 
 * Nonetheless, it probably remains true that users
 would wish to take the final budget output of all this
 automated stuff, and hack it up into something
 that somehow pleases them better. Thus it probably
 *does* make sense to allow hand edits at the final
 stage, and/or to simply enter an entire budget by
 hand if that is what you want to do.

 * So far, I don't see any simple way to implement
 something like Quicken's SuperCategories. Maybe this
 is related to why it works so poorly in Quicken. :-)
