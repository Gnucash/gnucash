	  src/register/register-gnome/gnucash-style.c: Bug #563273: Fix
	  crash on startup Here's the problem... GnuCash uses a hash table
	  with int keys to store dimensions, and the key value is the
	  number of rows in the dimension being stored. The problem is
	  that this key value is stored in a static int inside the
	  style_get_key function, which means that the key always has the
	  same address, and the hash functions in glib2 store the
	  *address*, not the *value* of the key. Unfortunately, the hash
	  algorithm changed some time between glib2-2.18.2 and
	  glib2-2.19.2, such that there's a hash conflict between the key
	  value 1 and the key value 2, but since the value of the already
	  hashed key was swiped out from under it when style_get_key
	  "created" a new key, the hash table entry that's already there
	  matches even when it shouldn't have. The attached patch cleans
	  this up by allocating memory to hold the key when inserting it
	  into the hash table. It also changes the way the hash table is
	  created to ensure that the memory is freed when a hash table
	  entry or hash table is destroyed. And while I was at it, I made
	  the same fix for the cursors hash table, which was also leaking
	  memory when entries were removed or the table was destroyed.

	  of the date-time issues, but has an additional twist because of
	  finance-quote. Somewhere between the fq-helper and the price db,
	  gnucash rolls the quote through timespecCanonicalDayTime(),
	  wherein it first runs localtime_r(), to produce, presumably,
	  "2008-11-03 19:00:00" for my Eastern US location. Having now
	  screwed up the date, gnucash runs gnc_tm_set_day_middle() on it

	  of AM_CFLAGS. AM_CFLAGS is passed both to the compiler (.c ->
	  .o) and to the linker, so it should only have flags that are
	  appropriate for both steps. AM_CPPFLAGS is passed only to the
	  compiler, so flags that are only appropriate for that step (-I
	  and -D flags, for example), should be in _CPPFLAGS instead of
	  _CFLAGS. Every gnucash-2.2.3 Makefile.am that passes -I flags
	  gets it wrong, placing them in _CFLAGS. It's not a functional
	  bug (the linker ignores -I flags), but a ton of superfluous
	  flags makes the build output pretty verbose and hard to debug
	  when things do go wrong. To make matters more confusing as a
	  developer, the FOO_CFLAGS variable set by PKG_CHECK_MODULES(FOO)
	  is actually for _CPPFLAGS in the Makefile.am ('pkg-config
	  --cflags' returns the -I flags). A related -I bug (one that *is*
	  functionally broken) is that sometimes a local (build dir) -I
	  flag is passed after a global (installed dependent library) one.
	  If my system happens to have a header installed from some
	  unrelated thing, compiler will find *that* one instead of the
	  expected one in the source directory. Should always pass all
	  local -I before any global ones. Patch by andi5 plus one manual
	  addition in src/gnome-utils/Makefile.am

	* [r17553] src/gnome-utils/gnc-amount-edit.c: GNCAmountEdit: Put
	  the text through the expression parser once instead of twice.
	  This caused a problem in locales that print negative numbers in
	  parentheses. For example, if you entered "-4/3", after the first
	  parse the displayed text would change to "(1 + 1/3)", meaning
	  negative one and one-third. Parsing that text a second time
	  changes the text to "1 + 1/3" since, to the expression parser,
	  parentheses indicate grouping rather than sign. The reason the
	  GNCAmountEdit was putting the text through the parser twice was
	  that it was setting gae->need_to_parse FALSE, but then
	  immediately calling gtk_entry_set_text(), which issues a
	  "changed" signal. The callback for that signal was setting
	  gae->need_to_parse back to TRUE. So I simply changed the order
	  of the statements. BP

	  src/register/ledger-core/split-register.c: Bug #340041, #436342:
	  Make the register keep track of whether the exchange rate has
	  been reset. This prevents a zero exchange rate from being
	  ambiguous: previously the register could not tell the difference
	  between "the user has not specified an exchange rate" and "the
	  user has specified a rate of zero". Much of this patch consists
	  of new ENTER(), DEBUG() and LEAVE() calls for debugging. Nearly
	  all of the rest is refactoring. The code that detected and acted
	  on changes to the account cell has been placed into its own
	  function, gnc_split_register_check_account(). The several calls
	  needed to checking a cell for changes have been combined in
	  gnc_split_register_check_cell(). About 15 lines represent actual
	  changes in functionality. Specifically, the code does a better
	  job of recognizing when an exchange rate needs to be requested
	  from the user, and when it does not. When an account cell is
	  changed in the register, and the new account is denominated in
	  the same commodity as the original, the original exchange rate
	  is used. On the other hand, if the commodity differs, the rate
	  is reset to zero. The register remembers that the zero exchange
	  rate is due to the reset (i.e. was not user-entered) so that the
	  the exchange rate dialog can be presented. Finally, the cell
	  contents are checked before doing a save; previously the checks
	  were missed in certain cases, e.g. if the user pressed "Enter"
	  or clicked the close button. BP

	  of a transaction job to pending, signifying that they accepted
	  the job but have not yet executed it. This also means that we
	  cannot detect whether the account is actually overdrafted.
	  Instead, ignore the return value of AB_Banking_ExecuteJobs() (it
	  will almost always be 0) and only check the job's status against
	  AB_Job_StatusFinished and AB_Job_StatusPending. If the status is

	  like subsequent map&unmaps though and do not make the search

	* [r16845] src/business/business-reports/owner-report.scm: fix
	  owner-report references broken by report-guid.

2008-01-08 02:10  warlord

	* [r16844] Makefile.am: Get distcheck working on FC7. Need to
	  ignore some files: ./share/icons/hicolor/icon-theme.cache and
	  ./share/info/dir these get created by the install system but
	  don't get deleted (and cannot be deleted because they could be
	  shared). So just ignore them.

2008-01-08 01:16  andi5

	* [r16842] src/pixmaps/Makefile.am: Fix compiling from tarball, as
	  art/ is not distributed. Patch from warlord. BP

2008-01-07 20:19  andi5

	* [r16837] make-gnucash-potfiles.in, po/POTFILES.ignore: Fix
	  r16733 and r16782 by removing the contents of po/POTFILES.ignore
	  from po/POTFILES. For more detail, see
	  http://lists.gnucash.org/pipermail/gnucash-devel/2008-January/022043.html.

2008-01-06 23:55  andrewsw

	* [r16836] src/app-utils/options.scm,
	  src/report/report-system/report.scm: Prevent crashing when a
	  report template disappears (#505921). If a report template is
	  missing (renamed, moved, deleted, whatever) while the report is
	  still open, then the app will crash while reading the books
	  file. The options-generator will fail and cause subsequent
	  attempts to access the options to fail and crash. A couple
	  checks for the existence of options is all it takes. Also
	  included a warning dialog. BP

2008-01-06 21:09  cstim

	* [r16834] configure.in: Fix goffice check that was broken for
	  goffice < 0.5.1. BP

2008-01-06 16:02  warlord

	* [r16828] src/import-export/qif-import/qif-to-gnc.scm: Better
	  handling of QIF Split transaction matching (#114724) If a QIF
	  split transaction is involved in a match then it always has
	  priority. The other half of the match will always be the half
	  that gets discarded, even if it is from an investment account.
	  Patch by Charles Day BP

2008-01-06 15:46  warlord

	* [r16826] src/import-export/qif-import/qif.glade: Always ask for

	  src/business/business-gnome/business-urls.c,
	  src/business/business-gnome/dialog-invoice.c: Complete gcc-4.2
	  fixes by disabling -Waddress in some business source files.
	  Patch from Jerry Quinn. BP

	* [r16821] src/register/ledger-core/split-register-load.c: Make
	  info message from r16718 and r16817 even more useful for
	  non-techie and probably windows users. BP

2008-01-06 02:53  andi5

	* [r16817] src/register/ledger-core/split-register-load.c: Make
	  info message from r16718 more useful for the non-techie user. BP

2008-01-05 21:39  cstim

	* [r16816] configure.in: Improve aqbanking version check add
	  maximum version to avoid confusion. The very latest aqbanking
	  series 3.x.x is not source compatible to 2.x.x. GnuCash is not
	  yet ported to that new series. Hence, we check that we really
	  have only those versions that are really supported. BP

2008-01-05 21:04  cstim

	* [r16814] accounts/de_DE/acctchrt_skr03.gnucash-xea: Fix typo in
	  German account template. BP

	  Report GUID. This is an internal representation of the report.
	  It frees up the various name fields for translation/changes
	  without concern about it breaking reports*. Each report is now
	  assigned a GUID that refers to that specific report. All
	  reference to the report is now done with this GUID. Support is
	  included for using existing open or saved reports of the old
	  reference-by-name type. The user is warned of the existence of
	  saved reports without a GUID. Support is also provided to allow
	  reports saved or left open using the new report-guid reference
	  to be accessed in 2.2.3(?) versions in case user downgrades.
	  IMPORTANT: All saved or open reports created using these changes
	  *will* *cause* *application* *crashes* if accessed in versions
	  prior to r16804. Earlier versions have neither the new functions
	  nor the report-record fields implemented here. It is a one-way
	  trip from pre-r16804 to here. I hope that is clear enough ;) *
	  going forward only. name changes will still break
	  non-report-guid saved or open reports.

	* [r16804] src/report/report-system/report-system.scm,
	  src/report/report-system/report.scm: prepare report system to
	  handle newer reports in case user downgrades from > 2.2.x The
	  incoming changes to the report system are not backwards
	  compatible with 2.2 branch. This should allow the reports opened
	  or saved by the new system to function in 2.2.x. BP

	* [r16803] src/report/standard-reports/income-statement.scm:
	  Re-introduce the Profit & Loss report. Just a renamed Income
	  Statement, because the average person doesn't know better. It's
	  the exact same report, just relabeled. Both reports are now
	  available in the menu. This change does re-add the translatable
	  string "Profit & Loss" BP
