Early Developers:
----------------
(In Historical Order)

Robin Clark wrote the original X-Accountant in Motif as a school
   project, taking it to version 0.9 by October 1997.  Although every
   single line of his code has been re-written (several times over),
   his name appears as a credit in almost every file.  Such is the
   power of copyrights.

Linas Vepstas liked what he saw: the GUI was slick, the code was
   documented and well structured, and it was all GPL'ed.  And so he
   re-wrote it: adding cell-widgets to XbaeMatrix, so that the
   combobox and arrows would make an even slicker GUI, rewrote the
   X-Accountant internals to add double-entry, an account hierarchy,
   split out a transaction mini-engine, add support for stocks, and
   spiffed up the help menus.  All for version 1.0 as of January 1998.
   Since then, for version 1.1 &amp; 1.2, the engine was expanded &amp;
   refined, and the register window code completely redesigned and
   made mostly Motif-(and GUI-)independent.

Jeremy Collins publicized the GnoMoney project widely and broadly, and
   then changed its name to GnuCash.  (Actually, he put the selection
   of the name up to popular vote. We all learned that democracy is
   not a good way to pick names.) Jeremy registered the domain name,
   and created and maintained the gnucash.org web site for years, and
   got the initial GTK/gnome code working.

Rob Browning abused everyone for not using perl, and then after we
   added Perl support, dumped Perl in favor of Guile/Scheme
   support. Rob added user preferences, re-wrote the reports in
   scheme, and contributed the change-over of the file-format to
   XML. He then concentrated on scheme performance and has been the
   g-wrap guile wrapper maintainer.

Dave Peticolas worked on most parts of Gnucash, especially the
   register and GUI.

Bill Gribble is not shy, or softly spoken. So don't be shy if you find
   a bug in his code: QIF import, query API and transaction search,
   check-printing, commodity and currency support, gtkhtml integration
   and report printing, pgp support, guppi integration, and the new
   main window layout.

Robert Graham Merkel extensive work on reports and reporting
   infrastructure, gnome GUI work, and user preferences.

James LewisMoss designed doc patches, XML refactoring, automated test
   suite, new file hierarchy import.

Christian Stimming was a report-generating monster. He's been one of
   the largest contributors to the report infrastructure, creating
   many of the important reports initially.  He has also contributed
   HBCI online banking support and manages internationalization and
   translation.

Joshua Sled worked on scheduled transactions and general project
   monkeying (IRC bot, logs, website maintenance, bug-triage, &amp;c.).

Derek Atkins wrote the business-accounting package for Gnucash. This
   includes the Customer/Vendor database, Job tracking, Order entry,
   Invoicing, Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable, and related
   technologies.  In the process he re-wrote the Query engine,
   modularized the Book object storage, and modularized the backend to
   allow pluggable objects.

David Hampton was an all-around hacker. He implemented a large porting
   of the gtk2 conversion.  He generally works on cleaning up the GUI
   and on fleshing out support for stocks. David has picked up Dave
   Peticolas's previous tendency to hack obsessively on
   GnuCash. (Something in the name?)

Chris Lyttle Administered the GnuCash bug list.  Improved the help and
   integrated and finished a concepts and tutorial written by Carol
   Champagne. Looks after releasing new GnuCash versions and updating
   the website.

Benoit Grégoire coded a long awaited OFX module for GnuCash and wrote
   the external libOFX library that it uses.

Neil Williams finished conversion from GncBook to QofBook and worked
   on the separation of QoF into a standalone library. He also
   contributed lots of Doxygen fixes and updates.

Chris Shoemaker implemented budgeting support for GnuCash. He replaced
   g-wrap by SWIG as GnuCash's guile wrapper generator and is also an
   all around hacker.

Andreas Köhler hunted down lots of bugs, especially for GUI code and
   other gtk related issues.

Charles Day overhauled the QIF importer and now focuses mainly on
   investment- and currency-related issues.
