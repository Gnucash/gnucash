/** @addtogroup Date
    Utility functions to handle date and time (adjusting, getting
    the current date, printing the date and time, etc.)

    Overall, this file is quite a mess.  Note, however, that other
    applications, besides just GnuCash, use this file.  In particular,
    GnoTime (gttr.sourcefore.net) uses this file, and this file is
    formally a part of QOF (qof.sourceforge.net).

    An important note about time-keeping:  The general goal of any
    program that works with numeric time values SHOULD BE to always
    stores and use UNIVERSAL TIME internally.  Universal time is the
    'one true time' that is independent of one's location on planet
    Earth.  It is measured in seconds from midnight January 1, 1970
    in localtime-Greenwich (GMT).  If one wants to display the local
    time, then the display-print routine should make all final
    tweaks to print the local time.   The local time *must not* be
    kept as a numeric value anywhere in the program.   If one wants
    to parse a user's input string as if it were local time, then
    the output of the parse routine MUST BE universal time.
    A sane program must never ever store (to file or db) a time
    that is not Universal Time.  Break these rules, and you will
    rue the day...

    \warning HACK ALERT -- the scan and print routines should probably be moved
    to somewhere else. The engine really isn't involved with things
    like printing formats. This is needed mostly by the GUI and so on.
    If a file-io backend needs date handling, it should do it itself,
    instead of depending on the routines here.
