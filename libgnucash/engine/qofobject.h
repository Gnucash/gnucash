/** @addtogroup Objects
    QOF Objects provide the means for associating
    a storage backend to a set of QOF Entities.   While an entity
    can be though of as an identified instance of some thing,  the
    QOF Object provides for a way to associate instances with
    a storage backend.  Storage might be file or SQL storage.

    QOF Objects are also used by the query system ....

    To work with your own QOF Objects, you can use the QOF
    Generator to create sample objects and a mini-application
    with the SQL-type query interface.
    http://qof-gen.sourceforge.net/

    XXX todo, we should split out the storage aspects of this
    thing from the 'foreach' that query depends on.  These are
    kinda unrelated concepts.
