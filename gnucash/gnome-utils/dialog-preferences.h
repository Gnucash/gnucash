    @brief Dialog for handling user preferences.
    @author Copyright (c) 2005 David Hampton <hampton@employees.org>

    These functions are the external API available for the user
    preference dialog. This dialog allows a user to modify
    several user preferences in the gnucash preferences database.
    Any module may add a page (or partial page) of preferences
    to the dialog.  These additions are done by providing
    the name of a glade file and the content to load from that
    file along with a widget in that file.  If a partial
    page is added, the widget name provided must be that of
    a GtkTable containing four columns. If a full page is added,
    the widget name provided to this code can be any kind of
    widget, but for consistency it should probably be the same.

    If a widget name is in the form pref/aaa.bbb/ccc... and it is a type
    of widget this code knows how to handle, then the widget is bound
    to the preference named ccc in group aaa.bbb. This means that if
    the widget's value changes, the preference is automatically updated.
    The same goes the other way around. This code currently knows about
    font buttons, radio buttons, check buttons, spin boxes, combo boxes,
    gnucash currency select widgets, gnucash accounting period widgets,
    and a gnucash date edit widget. (Combo boxes should not be used for
    less than five choices. Use a radio button group instead.)

    The argument *is* a glade file, so if your code has special
    requirements (e.g. make one widget insensitive until another is
    selected) feel free to go ahead and add your own callbacks to the
    glade file.  This code will connect any callbacks that exist in
    the glade file.
