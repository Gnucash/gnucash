\section stock splits & cost basis

OK, here's a question for accountants of various different countries:
What's the cost basis for a stock split? Does the rest of the world do
it the way the US does it?

For example:
In Jan 1995 buy 100s stock for $10 per share
In July 1997 split 2-for-1
In August 1997, sell 120s stock for $30 per share

I believe the following is correct for the united states:
My cost basis is $5 per share, and my gains of $25x120 are taxable
as long-term cap gains.

--- would there ever be a case where the cost basis should be $10 for
    the first 100 shares, and $0 for the remainder?
--- would there ever be a case where the gains would be considered
    'short-term' for some portion of the total?

\subsection Spin off stocks.

OK, that was easy. Here's the harder one: a spin-off:

For example:
In Jan 1995 buy 100s of stock A for $10 per share
In July 1997 receive 1s of stock B for every 20s of stock A.
Stock B is new, and will trade under its own new ticker symbol
as of the date of this split.

-- What's my cost basis for B? is it $0.000 ?
-- What's my cost basis for A? is it $10, or something else?
-- Are these questions supposed to be answered by company A,
   or do I just 'guess'?

Note there is still an invariant:
(old price of A) * 20s == (new price of A) *20s + (price of B) * 1s

\section Depreciation, Sinking Funds ...

The problem with proceeding to credit Cash and debit "Savings Goal" is
that this invalidates any reconciliation of Cash.  I'd be game to do
this if I credited not Cash, but rather "Cash:Goals", a subaccount of
Cash that can be ignored when it needs to be,

For different purposes, I will want both to consider and ignore these
"funds reservations."

- When making up a <b>budget</b>, I care about what funds are reserved for
   particular purposes.

- When trying to figure out if my bank account is going to be
overdrawn, "reserved" funds are <b>irrelevant.</b>

I would thus suggest that the "gentle user" use the budget system to
manage this rather than having these be "true" transactions in the
ledger.
