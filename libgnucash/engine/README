This directory contains code for the accounting engine.
Its fairly clean but far from perfect, and it certainly
lacks advanced features.

There should be no GUI code in this subdirectory, and,
ideally, it should build cleanly and independently of 
any GUI elements or assumptions.

For design documentation, please see the file "design.txt",
and also, look at the header files carefully.  The documentation
for each routine is in the header files for that routine.
