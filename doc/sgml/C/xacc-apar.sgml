<TITLE>Accounts Payable and Accounts Receivable</TITLE>
<PARA>A/R (Accounts Receivable) and A/P (Accounts Payable) are
    used by businesses to record sales
    for which they are not immediately paid, or to record bills that
    they have received, but might not pay until later.
    These types of accounts are used primarily when you've got a
    lot of bills and receipts flowing in and out, and don't want to
    lose track of them just because you don't pay/get paid right
    away.
    For most home users, A/R and A/P are too complicated
    and confusing to be worth the effort.

<TITLE> Accounts Receivable</TITLE>
<PARA>Let's assume that instead of requiring
    customers to pay <EMPHASIS>instantly,</EMPHASIS> in cash, 
    you issue
    them an invoice, and give them 30 days to pay the bills. (After
    30 days, we can start charging interest and sending out
    harassing letters :-)).
    When we make a sale, the two accounts affected are 
    <EMPHASIS>Sales</EMPHASIS> (an income account) and 
    <EMPHASIS>Accounts Receivable.</EMPHASIS>
    Accounts Receivable is an asset, but it's not "liquid," as you
    can't readily sell it, and it's certainly not cash.
    When the customer pays the bill, 
    you transfer the amount from A/R to Cash.
    This is done in two steps because you have decided
    to do your accounting on an accrual basis and not on a
    cash basis.  This is because most of your transactions are not solely
    based on cash changing hands, but rather based on 
    <EMPHASIS>establishing obligations.</EMPHASIS>
    </PARA>

<PARA>In more sophisticated operations, there may be a much more
    complex sequence of documents generated and tracked:

    <ITEMIZEDLIST>
<LISTITEM>
<PARA>A customer sends in a <EMPHASIS>Purchase Order</EMPHASIS>,
      which authorizes a purchase.

      </PARA>
</LISTITEM>
<LISTITEM>
<PARA>A <EMPHASIS>Work Order</EMPHASIS> to schedule production of
      whatever the customer is buying.
      </PARA>
</LISTITEM>
<LISTITEM>
<PARA>A <EMPHASIS>Shipping Notice</EMPHASIS> is issued, to ship to goods to
      the customer.

      </PARA>
</LISTITEM>
<LISTITEM>
<PARA>Once shipped, an <EMPHASIS>Invoice</EMPHASIS> is issued, representing
      the <EMPHASIS>request to pay</EMPHASIS>.
    </PARA>

    </PARA>
<PARA>Sales are reported as soon as they occur.
    Unfortunately, you may wind up selling some product to
    no-good shady operators that you didn't know were shady, and
    thus may get stuck with some "bad debts."
    In order to determine which parts of Accounts Receivable
    appear to be most at risk, it is typical to arrange A/R based on
    the "ages" of the debts, commonly segmenting it into several
    aging periods, of payments outstanding 0-30 days, those that
    outstanding 31-60 days, 61-90 days, and then those that are
    <EMPHASIS>way overdue.</EMPHASIS>
    At some point, it may become clear that a customer is never
    going to pay what they owe, and we have to write it off as a
    <EMPHASIS>Bad Debt.</EMPHASIS>
    At that point, it is typical to record an entry thus:

    <TABLE>

<PARA>You could have reduced <EMPHASIS>Sales Income</EMPHASIS> instead, but
    companies tend to prefer to specifically track the amount that
    they're losing to bad customers.

    </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS>Warning: <EMPHASIS>Advanced Accounting Concept.</EMPHASIS> 
    Bad Debt is
    an example of a "contra-account." That doesn't refer to 
    <EMPHASIS>amounts paid to Nicaraguan rebels,</EMPHASIS> 
    but rather the notion
    that the account is an income account that is expected to hold
    a balance opposite to what is normally expected, to be
    counteract the balance in another income account. 
    <LINK LINKEND="XACC-DEPRECIATION">Accumulated Depreciation,</LINK> used to
    diminish the value of an asset over time, is another example of
    a contra-account.</EMPHASIS>

<TITLE> Accounts Payable</TITLE>
<PARA>To see how Accounts Payable work, reverse the scenario for
    Accounts Receivable; switch customer with supplier.

    <ITEMIZEDLIST>
<LISTITEM>
<PARA>If you buy materials "on account," accrual accounting
      requires that you record the expense
      immediately.  Rather than reducing cash, put the
      "credit" into the <EMPHASIS>Accounts Payable</EMPHASIS> account.

      </PARA>

<PARA>Three weeks later, the invoice comes in. You issue a

<PARA>    </PARA>
<PARA>The same techniques are also used for pre-paid expenses.
    If you have to pay out down six months of rent in advance,
    that is treated as an "accrued asset."

    <ITEMIZEDLIST>
<LISTITEM>
<PARA> At the time of payment, you <EMPHASIS>debit</EMPHASIS> 
        <EMPHASIS>Prepaid Rent</EMPHASIS> for the amount paid,
        which is a <EMPHASIS>credit</EMPHASIS> to
        <EMPHASIS>Cash.</EMPHASIS> 
        This puts an unfortunate dent in the Cash account,
        but it <EMPHASIS>does</EMPHASIS> show on the books as an asset, and there
        are no more payments to make for the next six months.

<PARA>Each month, the balance in <EMPHASIS>Prepaid Rent</EMPHASIS> goes
