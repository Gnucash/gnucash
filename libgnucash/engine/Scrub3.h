/** The xaccScrubLot() routine makes sure that the indicated lot is

 *    This is an important routine to call if the amount of any split
 *    in the lot is changed.  That's because (obviously) changing
 *    split values is guaranteed to throw off lot balances.
 *    This routine may end up closing the lot, or at least trying
 *    to. It will also cause cap gains to be recomputed.
 *
 *    Scrubbing the lot may cause subsplits to be merged together,
 *    i.e. for splits to be deleted.  This routine returns true if
 *    any splits were deleted.

 *    lot structure, and the cap-gains for an account are in good
 *    order.
 *
 * Most GUI routines will want to use one of these xacc[*]ScrubLots()
 * routines, instead of the various component routines, since it will
