# Invoke this script like the following example

#   2010 1 monthly 12 \
#   debits-show credits-show Assets 'Test Account'
#
# That will do an analysis on the account 'Assets:Test Account' from
# gnucash_file.xac, all of the debits and all of the credits will be shown
# and summed on for 12 monthly periods starting from January (1st month) 2010
# 
# if you just want to see the credit and debit sums for each period, use
# the debits-noshow and credits-noshow argument
#
# The output goes to stdout and is in csv format.

# Account path arugments are space separated, so you need to quote parts of
# the account path with spaces in them
#
# available period types are monthly quarterly and yearly
#
# At the moment this script only supports GnuCash files of the sqllite3 type
# its an easy edit to switch to xml: etc...
