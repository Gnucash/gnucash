/** \page backuppolicy Backup Design

API: \ref Backend

Currently, backups and log files are automatically stored by the engine
with date/time stamps every time the user hits 'save' in the gui.

(The actual file writing is done by xaccWriteAccountGroupFile() in
in src/engine/FileIOP.h)

\section backupchanges Proposed design changes:

-# Allow user to configure which directory backups should be put into.
   (currently, this is same as current directory).  Requires changes to
   engine FileIOP.h as well as GUI.\n
   One possible default is ~/.gnucash/data/  (Which is supposed to 
   be the place where files are saved if no directory is specified.!?)
-# Prompt the user to make a backup every third save.  Make this number
   configurable. If no default backup path set, prompt to set it,
   with suggested path being ~/.gnucash/backups/
-# If save format was XML text, then could use RCS ...
	Alternately,
	For those that don't know, xdelta is like RCS, but it's designed to
	handle any kind of data, including binary, is supposed to work really
	well, and transparently handles gzipped data with some form of MD5sum
	verification.  It's also available in library form.  Like RCS it would
	give us the ability to do cool things like snapshot the data every so
	often for nearly no cost.  Want to see what things looked like 6
	months ago?  Just enter the right date into the "time-warp" dialog :>\n
	For those on Debian systems, just install the xdelta and
	libxdelta2-dev packages.  Others can get the source from
	ftp://www.xcf.berkeley.edu/pub/xdelta/, or just go to
	ftp.debian.org:/pub/debian/dists/unstable/main/source/utils/xdelta*.tar.gz
-# Could monitor how many changes (records altered) the user has made,
   and could prompt for more frequent saves if lots of editing has
   ocurred...
