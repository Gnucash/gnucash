/** The Policy routines try to encapsulate the FIFO/LIFO-specific
 *  parts of the cap-gains routine, and can be replaced by something
 *  else for other policies.
 *
 *  The PolicyGetLot() routine returns a lot into which the
 *     indicated split should be placed.
 *
 *  The PolicyGetSplit() routine returns an unassigned split
 *     from the account that is appropriate for placing into the
 *     indicated lot.  For the FIFO policy, that would be the
 *     earliest split that is not in any account, and is of the
 *     appropriate sign.  For a LIFO, it would be the latest.
 *
 *  The PolicyIsOpeningSplit() predicate returns a true/false
 *     value, indicating if the indicated split was used to 'open'
 *     or 'grow' the lot.
 *
 *  The PolicyGetLotOpening() routine returns information about
 *     the opening balances for the lot.  The 'opening balances'
 *     are the sum of all the splits used to grow (increase the size
 *     of) the lot.  For a LIFO or FIFO policy, there is only one
 *     split that opens a lot.
