QIF file format
---------------
The QIF is an old and rather broken file format defined by Intuit
for exporting Quicken data.  It is 'broken' because the format
is ambiguous in many places, non-standard between different releases
and applications, and even varies subtly from country to country (in
particular, the way dates and amounts are represented), and fails
to define important data (such as the currency denomination, or the 
exchange rates when transferring between accounts marked in different
currencies).  Importing a QIF file can require significant manual
intervention by the user in order to get the data straight.

Extensions
----------
TEF -- Time and Expense Format (see below)

QFX -- also known as 'Web Connect' --  very similar, and is the
       'new' standard for on-line bank statement downloads.
       (??? or is it just 'ofx in a file' ???)

Type of account identifiers
----------------------------
!Type:Bank     Bank account
!Type:Bill     ??? (bill presentment ???)
!Type:Cash     Cash account
!Type:CCard    Credit Card account
!Type:Invoice  ??? (invoice presentment ???)
!Type:Invst    Investment account
!Type:Oth A    Asset account
!Type:Oth L    Liability account
!Type:Tax      ???

!Account         Account list or which account applies to following 
                 transactions 

!Type:Cat        Category list
!Type:Class      Class list
!Type:Memorized  Memorized transaction list 

Note that !Account is used both to be a header for account information,
and to be a header for a list of transactions.

Also note that international versions of Quicken and MS Money often
translate the Type: tags into the local language.  But not always.

Time and Expense Format
-----------------------
The following QIF extension added by Iambic Software
to handle time and expense tracking.  This is used in particular
by handhelds (Palm and WinCE).  TEF is claimed to be a superset
of the QIF format.

TEF Files begin with the header:
#TEF VERSION X.YYY 
Documented below is version 1.01

#      Any line beginning with # is a comment and not parsed 
B      City 
F      Reported           
H      Report # 
J      Attendees 
K      Reimbursable 
R      Receipt 
U      Begin Odometer 
V      End Odometer 
W      Private 
X      Exchange Rate 
Z      User 

1      Client 
2      Project 
3      Activity

6      Vehicle 
7      Currency

?      Keyword: TIME, EXPENSE, CLIENT, PROJECT, ACTIVITY, TYPE,
       TASK, VEHICLE, PAYEE, CURRENCY. If absent, entry is 
       assumed EXPENSE type as compatible with QIF 

*      Duration hh:mm:ss

[      Start time

When importing type CLIENT, PROJECT, ACTIVITY, TYPE, TASK, VEHICLE,
PAYEE, CURRENCY the following are used:

General Notes
=====================================================================


Dates: 
------

Dates in US QIF files are usually in the format MM/DD/YY, although
four-digit years are not uncommon.  Dates sometimes occur without the
slash separator, or using other separators in place of the slash,
commonly '-' and '.'.  US Quicken seems to be using the ' to indicate
post-2000 two-digit years (such as 01/01'00 for Jan 1 2000).  Some
banks appear to be using a completely undifferentiated numeric string
formateed YYYYMMDD in downloaded QIF files.

European QIF files may have dates in the DD/MM/YY format.  

Monetary Amounts:
-----------------

These typically occur in either US or European format:

10,000.00  Ten Thousand Dollars (US format)
10.000,00  Ten Thousand Francs  (European format)

An apostrophe is also used in some cases:

10'000.00  Ten Thousand Dollars (Quicken 4)
10'000,00  Ten Thousand Francs  (unconfirmed)

Within a given QIF file, the usage of a particular numeric format
appears to be consistent within a particular field but may be
different from one field to another.  For example, the Share Amount
field can be in European format but the Split Amount in US.  No
radix-point is required and no limit on decimal places is evident, so
it's possible to see the number "1,000" meaning "1 franc per share"
"1,000" meaning "one thousand shares" in the same transaction (!).


Investment Actions:
-------------------

The N line of investment transactions specifies the "action" of the
transaction. Although not a complete list, possible values include
the following:

XOut          Transfer cash to another account.


Category/Transfer/Class line: 
-----------------------------

The "L" line of most transactions specifies the category, transfer
account, and class (if any) of the transaction.  Square brackets 
surrounding the contents mean the transaction is a transfer to the 
named account.  A forward slash separates the category/account from
the class.  So overall, the format is one of the following:

   LCategory of transaction
   L[Transfer account]
   LCategory of transaction/Class of transaction
   L[Transfer account]/Class of transaction

In stock transactions, if the 'N' field (action) is MiscIncX or
MiscExpX, there can be *two* account/class pairs on the L line, with
the second guaranteed to be a transfer.  I believe they are
separated by a '|', like so:
   
   D01/01/2000
   NMiscExpX
   T1000.00
   Lexpense category/expense class|[Transfer account]/transfer class


Cleared Status line:
--------------------

The "C" line of specifies the cleared status. The second character
in the line, if present, may be any of:

* Cleared
C Cleared
X Reconciled
R Reconciled
? Budgeted
! Budgeted
