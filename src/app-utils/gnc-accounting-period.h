    @brief General utilities for dealing with accounting periods.
    @author David Hampton <hampton@employees.org>

    These are general utility functions for specifying an accounting
    period and converting it to a value usable by the gnucash engine.
    The choice of src/app-utils is arbitrary as these utilities don't
    fit well anywhere else.  They are at a higher level than a GDate,
    so they don't fit in src/core-utils/gnc-gdate-utils.c.  They don't
    operate on engine data structures, so they don't belong in
    src/engine/Period.c.  Putting them into src/engine/gnc-date.c
    would be the best place for them, but then that creates a new
    dependency from the src/engine directory to the src/core-utils
    directory that doesn't currently exist.  Since that might be a
    problem for CashUtils, the app-file directory was chosen.
