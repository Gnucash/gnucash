Status of the GDA backend.

Code for all standard and business objects has been written.  The branch has been
merged with the trunk through rev 17070.  The following bugs/issues are known.

* Transactions are saved with dates at 00:00:00 o'clock.  This often/usually has
the result that the transactions are shown on the day before they were entered (I
am at TZ -0500).
* When saving from another file, the billterms table is not created/saved.  Instead,
it will be created when the file is next opened. (libgda bug 527923)
* Initial save performance is better than it used to be, but is still slow.  For
example, saving my file with ~8000 transactions and ~21000 splits takes 13 minutes
to an sqlite db.
* The 'Database Connection' action (File menu) should see if the db already exists
and should allow the user to connect to and open an existing file, not always
overwrite it.
* Foreign key definitions should be used for referential integrity.
* The db should contain some indication of its schema version number.  When opening
a db, gnucash should see if the schema is up to date, and should update it if it
isn't.
* (Maybe) Keep an 'old values' table for each main table.  When a record is updated,
copy the old record to the 'old values' table first to keep track of any changes.
* Use prepared statements
* Use cursor-based data models when reading from the db for better performance
* Write automated tests
* Write doxygen comment headers
* Don't need a log file
* Certain dialogs create an object when opened and update it as they go along. This
can result in trying to save invalid objects:
	- Price editor (new price has no commodity or currency)
	- New invoice
