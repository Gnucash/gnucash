# This script takes a gnucash url
# and creates a new file/db at a second url that has the same
# account tree and an equivalent opening balance on all the simple balance
# sheet accounts (not for income and expense accounts)
#
# This is done a per currency basis, one opening balance account for each
#
# For non-simple balance sheet accounts (like payable, recievable, stock,
# mutual, and trading, you'll have to put the opening balance in yourself
#
# Invocation examples:
# python3 new_book_with_opening_balances.py \
#   '/home/mark/test.gnucash'
#   'sqlite3:///home/mark/new_test.gnucash'
#
# python3 new_book_with_opening_balances.py \
#   '/home/mark/test.gnucash' \
#   'xml:///crypthome/mark/parit-financial-system/new_test.gnucash'
#
# Remember that the gnucash python package has to be in your PYTHONPATH
# if you're installed GnuCash in a non-standard location, you'll have to do
# something like this
# export PYTHONPATH=gnucash_install_path/lib/python2.x/site-packages/

# argv[1] should be the path to an existing gnucash file/database
# For a file, simply pass the pathname. GnuCash will determine the data format
# xml or sqlite3 automatically.
# For a database you can use these forms:
#   mysql://user:password@host/dbname
#   postgres://user:password@host[:port]/dbname (the port is optional)
#
# argv[2] should be the path for the new gnucash file/database
# For a file, simply pass the pathname prefixed with the requested data format
# like:
#   xml:///home/blah/blah.gnucash
#   sqlite3:///home/blah/blah.gnucash
# Paths can also be relative, for example:
#   xml://from-here/to/there/blah.gnucash
# For a database you can use these forms:
#   mysql://user:password@host/dbname
#   postgres://user:password@host[:port]/dbname (the port is optional)
