2001-03-07  Bill Gribble  <grib@billgribble.com>

	* summary: separate the HTML and HTTP processing functions into
	different files to facilitate reuse.  Modularize much of the
	gnucash-specific behavior of the HTML code (<object> and form
	submission) to use run-time-expandable bahavior tables.  Add the
	gnc-action: mechanism for installing form submission handlers.

	* src/gnome/gng-gpg.c: initialize gnc-html handler for crypted
	HTML objects.  Remove all mention of GPG from gnc-html.c

	* src/gnome/gnc-html-actions.c: new file.  Add a simple form
	submission action (action=gnc-action:gnc-info/form?CGI_URL) to
	test submit and action processing.  This is useless ATM.  Some of
	the stuff in the privacy comments is unimplemented yet.

	* src/gnome/gnc-html-guppi.c: move all Guppi references from
	gnc-html.c into a separate file, with an initializer for 
	the Guppi <object> tags. 

	* src/gnome/gnc-html.c: get rid of SSL references; all that stuff
	is now in gnc-http.c.  Restructure to use gnc-http instead of
	ghttp directly.  Finish GET and POST default handlers, and add
	handler lookup/install mechanism for gnc-action: actions.  crib
	urlencoding function from gtkhtml guts.

	* src/gnome/gnc-http.c: new file.  Move HTTP stuff here. Finish
	POST handling.

	* src/gnome/top-level.c: add calls to Guppi, GPG, and gnc-html
	init functions.  These calls will eventually go into loadable
	module startup functions, when we get loadable modules.

	* src/scm/html-text.scm: Add html-markup/format.
	(html-markup/format "%a %a %a %a" 1 2 3 4) does what you'd expect,
	even if the non-format args are html-markup objects.
	
2001-03-07  Dave Peticolas  <dave@krondo.com>

	* src/gnome/druid-commodity.c: fix for new commodity insert

	* src/engine/gnc-commodity.c: change commodity insert semantics to
	use an existing commodity if present. Remove
	gnc_commodity_table_remove(). It wasn't used and was a mem leak.

	* src/engine/Commodity-xml-parser-v1.c
	(commodity_restore_end_handler): use gnc_commodity_destroy,
	not just g_free.

2001-03-05  Dave Peticolas  <dave@krondo.com>

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-item-edit.{ch}: improve horizontal
	scrolling behavior.

2001-03-05  Christian Stimming  <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* src/scm/html-utilities.scm: reorganizing of the hierarchical

	passed in.

2001-03-01  Dave Peticolas  <dave@krondo.com>

2001-03-01  Robert Graham Merkel  <rgmerk@mira.net>

	* src/scm/report/transaction-report.scm (add-split-row): Now 
	uses date-posted rather than date-entered.
	(used-<foo>, build-column-used): use a vector rather than a 
	record.  *Big* speedup :)

	(gnc:html-document-markup-end): use new closing-font-tag? variable
	for more speedup.

	* src/scm/html-document.scm (<html-markup-style-info>): add new
	closing-font-tag? variable to speedup closing tags.  Also modify
	setter functions to set closing-font-tag to appropriate values,
	and add a setter and getter for it.
	(gnc:html-style-info-markup-set): modify to set closing-font-tag
	to appropriate state.
	(gnc:html-style-info-markup-merge): modify to set closing-font-tag
	to appropriate state

	* src/scm/html-table.scm: replace for-each-in-order with for-each,
	which has exactly the same semantics according to R5RS (which
	guile is a superset of).  Was done in hope of speedup, but none
	forthcoming.  Didn't change back because for-each is R5RS, but
	for-each-in-order isn't.  Probably should make the substitution
	globally.

2001-02-28  Dave Peticolas  <dave@krondo.com>

	* src/engine/Transaction.c (xaccSplitsComputeValue): fix a bug

	* src/engine/gnc-book.c (gnc_book_load): fix spelling

	leak. 
	(test_add_account): new func.

	(gnc_transaction_end_handler): same as below.

	* src/engine/gnc-commodity-xml-v2.c (gnc_commodity_end_handler):
	Use data struct from io-gncxml-v2.h

	* src/engine/gnc-account-xml-v2.c (account_currency_handler): Make
	not use engine commodity funcs to make this testable.  Will have
	to have something to clean this up in production code.
	(account_security_handler): Same.
	(gnc_xml_set_account_data): Oops.  Actually set that we have
	gotten this so the got all test succeeds.
	(gnc_account_end_handler): Start the main parsing setup by relying
	on data struct from io-gncxml-v2.h
	(gnc_account_end_handler): fix free to free the correct thing.
	Add some g_warning calls to make errors more apparent.

2001-02-28  Dave Peticolas  <dave@krondo.com>

	* src/FileDialog.c: store the original (not comma-fied) version

2001-02-28  Robert Graham Merkel  <rgmerk@mira.net>

	* src/scm/report/transaction-report.scm: Formatting cleanups.
	Gotta keep Dave P happy . . .

	* src/scm/html-table.scm: html table data field list now stored in
	*reverse* order, to make appending rows fast (prepending is now
	O(n^2) however.  If we want linear-time appends and prepends,
	we'll need a Glist wrapper :) )

	* src/scm/report/folio.scm: use renamed collector functions (dunno
	why, code is dead . . .)

	* src/scm/report/taxtxf.scm: use renamed collector functions (see
	above)

	arguments unless it's going to be printed.

2001-02-25  Robert Graham Merkel  <rgmerk@mira.net>

	* src/engine/Query.[ch]: added support for sorting by account
	names and codes, as well as names and codes for the "other" split
	in the transaction.  also, modified (xaccQuerySetSortIncreasing)
	so you can sort in different orders for the three criteria
	specified.

	* src/engine/Transaction.[ch]: Added new functions for comparing
	splits on account names and codes.

	* src/engine/reconcile-list.c (gnc_reconcile_list_set_sort_order):
	modified to use new query sorting interface.
	
	* src/scm/report/transaction-report-2.scm: New file.  Transaction
	report rewritten for our new improved HTML generator.  Most 
	functionality is now present, but the layout is "homely".  Will 
	fix later.

	* src/scm/report/transaction-report.scm: Old transaction report,
	removed.

	* src/scm/report/report-list.scm: added new transaction report.

	* src/scm/report-utilities.scm: modified for new query sorting
	interface.

	* src/doc/design/multicurrency.discussion.txt: The log of an IRC
	discussion between cstim and myself about his currency-collector
	code.  Included because it's the only documentation we have on
	this material.

	* src/doc/design/.cvsignore: ignore additional generated files.

2001-02-24  Rob Browning  <rlb@cs.utexas.edu>

	* configure.in (AC_ARG_ENABLE): add --enable-error-on-warning.
	Enables -Werror and whatever else is needed for super-strict
	checks.  I'm compiling with this now, and I urge everyone else to
	as well.  We do have a few aggravating things we still ignore,
	like unused variables, but as of today, the whole codebase
	compiles successfully with this turned on.
	(AC_CHECK_PROG): Add a check for etags.
	(AC_ARG_WITH): --with-perl-includes - don't die if CORE not found.
	I install modules in a local directory and use --perl-includes to
	enable gnucash to find Finance::Quote at runtime, but there won't
	be a CORE file.
	(AC_CHECK_LIB): popt - note required Debian -dev package. 

	* macros/autogen.sh (conf_flags): omit --enable-compile-warnings.
	This was adding flags that overrode our configure.in settings;
	specifically, this kept --enable-error-on-warning from working.

	* Makefile.am (noinst_DATA): add optional TAGS target.
	(DISTCLEANFILES): add tags cleanup bits.
	(TAGS): Add fancy TAGS handling.  TAGS file is only built if you
	have etags available, and now it takes into account
	additions/deletions of files in addition to modifications.

	* src/engine/gnc-engine-util.c
	(g_hash_table_key_value_pairs): new - returns a GSList of all the
	key value pairs in a given hash table so you can manipulate them.
	(g_hash_table_kv_pair_free_gfunc): new - g_slist_foreach helper
	for deleting key value hash pairs when you're finished with the
	results from g_hash_table_key_value_pairs.  You'll still need to
	call g_slist_free as well to delete the spine of the list.

	* src/engine/NetIO.c: comment out various bits of the code that's
	incompatible with the recent gnc-book changes.  Linas said he'd
	fix it later.

	* src/scm/price-quotes.scm: new file - not used yet.

	* src/scm/price-quotes.scm: new file - launch a sub-process you
	can talk to bidirectionally from scheme read/write.

	* src/scm/command-line.scm: (disabled) support for getting prices.

	* src/scm/command-line.scm
	(gnc:group-map-accounts): implementation simplified dramatically,
	probably should be dropped entirely, in favor of just calling (map
	thunk (gnc:group-get-subaccounts group)) -- which is what's in the
	replacement code.

	* src/quotes/price-quote-helper.in: new file.

	* src/Backend.h: Delete ERR_FILEIO_MISC (use ERR_BACKEND_MISC).
	Replace ERR_FILEIO_ALLOC with ERR_BACKEND_ALLOC.

	* src/engine/gnc-book.c: add support for GNCPriceDB element.  Move
	still relevant FileIO bits here.  Add support for gnc-book
	clean/dirty checking instead of just Group checking.

	* src/engine/gnc-book.h: fixes for gnc-book marking, private
	header, and addition of pricedb.

	* src/engine/gnc-book-p.h: new file - private book functions.

	* src/engine/Ledger-xml-parser-v1.c
	(ledger_data_after_child_handler): new function to handle grabbing
	the pricedb when we hit it.

	* src/FileDialog.c: Various fixes to replace uses of the top level
	AccountGroup with the parent GNCBook.  Also add support for
	reading/writing the GNCPriceDB.  This file still needs a lot of
	work.  Much of it should become a proper file IO Backend.

	* src/guile/gnc.gwp: Add <gnc:Book*>.  Add gnc:get-current-book.
	Add gnc:book-get-group. Add gnc:account-get-price-src.

	* src/gnome/druid-commodity.c (finish_helper): add support for
	GNCPriceDB.

	* src/engine/sixtp-writers.h: add support for GNCPriceDB.

	* src/engine/sixtp-to-dom-parser.c
	(sixtp_dom_parser_new): change signature to add fail and result
	cleanup functions.  These can be NULL, in which case they're
	ignored.  Also modify overall scheme to clean internal garbage up
	properly in case of failure.

	* src/engine/sixtp-parsers.h
	(sixtp_dom_parser_new): change signature.

	* src/engine/sixtp-dom-parsers.c (dom_tree_to_text): minor fixes.

	* src/engine/sixtp-dom-generators.c
	(text_to_dom_tree): new function.

	* src/engine/sixtp-dom-generators.h
	(text_to_dom_tree): new prototype.

	* src/engine/io-gncxml-w.c: add support for pricedb and using
	GNCBook at top level rather than Group.

	* src/engine/io-gncxml.h: support migration from top level Group
	to top level GNCBook.

	* src/engine/io-gncbin-r.c: add support for detecting legacy
	prices and migrating them to the new pricedb.  Replace top level
	uses of a Group with a GNCBook.

	* src/engine/io-gncbin.h: support pricedb and gnc-book changes.

	* src/engine/io-gncxml-p.h: new file - private header.

	* src/engine/io-gncxml-r.c: move bits to private header.  Make
	changes to support move from top level to Group to top level
	GNCBook.

	* src/gnome/druid-qif-import.c: -Werror fixes.

	* src/engine/gnc-pricedb.h: new file.

	* src/engine/gnc-pricedb-p.h: new file.

	* src/engine/gnc-pricedb.c: new file.

	* src/engine/gnc-pricedb-xml-v1.c: new file.

	* src/engine/date.h (timespec_equal): add back.

	* src/engine/date.c (timespec_equal): add back.

	date format string.

	* src/engine/sixtp-dom-parsers.c (Repository): Add funcs from
	Rob.  make consistent.  Fix a few bugs.  Make
	dom_tree_to_commodity_ref testable by adding new func
	"associate_commodity_ref_with_engine_commodity" to do final
	association with engine commodity table.

	* src/engine/sixtp-dom-generators.c (Repository): Fix to_guid to
	be generic.  Oops.  Add rest of funcs to to foo_to_dom_tree to

	locale-based date formatting and parsing.

2001-02-14  Bill Gribble  <grib@billgribble.com>

	log10 error

	* src/guile/gnc-helpers.c: start to fix scm_to_gint64 for
	guile-1.3.. this is sort of a duct-tape fix.  We need to port some
	stuff from the guile-1.4 source tree.  Should work fine unless you
	are Bill Gates and you do your accounting in lira.

	* src/gnome/dialog-style-sheet.c: handle WM delete event 

	* src/scm/qif-import/qif-to-gnc.scm: fix backtrace-if-exception

2001-02-12  Bill Gribble  <grib@billgribble.com>

	* src/scm/html-style-info.scm: minor fixes to html style
	compile

	* various in src/scm: fixes for i18n .. use (N_ instead of (_ 
	where appropriate. 

	* src/engine/gnc-numeric.{c,h}, src/scm/gnc-numeric.scm: add
	support for a new auto-denom type, GNC_DENOM_SIGFIGS(x), where x
	is the number of "significant figures" you want in the output.
	This means that the output denominator will always be a poewr of
	10, but which power is determined by the magnitude of the
	argument.

	* src/engine/Transaction.c, src/gnc-exp-parser.c,
	src/gnc-ui-util.c: make minor changes to use GNC_DENOM_SIGFIGS
	where appropriate.

	* src/gnome/dialog-account-picker.{c,h}: totally rewritten QIF
	import account picker.  this one is much less likely to get you
	into trouble.  Still some rough edges but MUCH better than
	the old one.
	
	* src/gnome/druid-qif-import.c: fixes.  Add memo/payee matching
	(but it's not hooked up to the import yet so don't get that 
	excited).

	* src/scm/qif-import/qif-dialog-utils.scm: memo mapping stuff,
	i18n fixes.

	* src/scm/qif-import/qif-to-gnc.scm: update error catching; print

2001-02-08  Bill Gribble  <grib@billgribble.com>

	* src/gnome/druid-qif-import.c: restructure druid a bit to 
	allow more flexible navigation (in particular, so we can have 
	a global pref to skip documentation pages)

	* src/scm/html-*.scm: change rendering model to speed up reports.
	use a "string tree" instead of the old with-output-to-string and
	compile style tables where possible.  Strangely enough, alists
	are faster than hash tables.

	* src/scm/html-table.scm: clean up row/col style stuff a little.
	semantics changed a wee bit: now row style takes precedence over
	column style.  this was necessary for performance.

	* src/scm/prefs.scm: add a global pref to skip doc pages in the 
	QIF importer. 

	* src/scm/report.scm: shuffle around a bit for the new rendering
	model.

	* src/gnome/window-report.c: back out some overly-aggressive
	memory reclamation.  I need to figure out how to do this right.

2001-02-08  Christian Stimming  <stimming@tuhh.de>

	table. Add function to print exchange rates.

	* src/scm/report-utilities.scm: Modify commodity-collector to
	enable more sign reversals and usage of gnc-monetary. Add option
	creation functions common to several reports.

	* src/scm/report/account-summary.scm: Removed function now in
	report-utilities.scm. Added variables for option names.

	* src/scm/report/pnl.scm: New Profit And Loss report, based on
	account-summary report.

	sixtp_parse_file and sixtp_parse_buffer here from io-gncxml-r.c
	Add concept of a parsing context to hold data.

	* src/engine/sixtp-stack.h: Add creator.  Add headers.

	* src/engine/sixtp-stack.c: Add creator.

	* src/engine/sixtp-parsers.h: add needed headers.
	Add func from sixtp-to-dom-parser.c

	* src/engine/io-gncxml.h: Fix name.

	* src/engine/io-gncxml-w.c: Fix name.

	* src/engine/io-gncxml-r.c: Fix name.  Create stack frame creator
	function and use here.

2001-02-05  James LewisMoss  <dres@phoenixdsl.com>

	* src/engine/sixtp-stack.h: Add glib.h include (needed for GSList)

	* src/engine/sixtp.c: Add catchall tag for parsing handlers.  Use
	name instead of next_parser_tag since that can now contain a magic
	value.

2001-02-05  Bill Gribble  <grib@billgribble.com>

	* src/scm/qif-import/qif-merge-groups.scm: new file.  Utilities
	for detecting duplicate transactions in two account groups.

	* src/scm/qif-import/qif-quick-import.scm: new file (unfinished).
	A start at a "quick import" facility that will import a single
	QIF file with very little interaction. 

	* src/engine/Group.c: be sure to free account split list and
	set to NULL on merge

	* src/engine/Query.c: add a new API to get Transactions from a
	query instead of splits.  you have to specify whether you want
	transactions with one split matching the query or all splits
	matching the query.  More options later.

	* src/gnome/druid-qif-import.c : add a few slots to the 
	QIF window struct and add the extra pages to the dialog to 
	allow review and selection of duplicate transactions 

	* src/guile/gnc.gwp: wrap new Query functions and enums; wrap 
	gnc:group-concat-group 

	* src/scm/gnc-numeric.scm: add gnc-numeric enumerated types.  
	They need to be bitwise combined so don't use g-wrap enum 
	features.

	* src/scm/qif-import/qif-to-gnc.scm: change semantics slightly to
	put new xtns in a new Group and return it before committing.

2001-02-05  Christian Stimming  <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* src/scm/html-utilities.scm: Added sorting of accounts according
	to their account-code. Added calculation of a total sum.

	* src/scm/report-utilities.scm: Improved calculation of the
	exchange rates such more complicated currency configurations can
	be handled.

2001-02-03  Christian Stimming  <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* src/scm/html-utilities.scm: add account table generating
	function which builds a hierarchy and is generalized enough to be
	used in balance- and profit-and-loss style reports. (moved from
	report/account-summary.scm)

2001-02-02  Christian Stimming  <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* src/scm/report-utilities.scm: add function for determining the
	account tree depth (moved from account-summary)

	* src/gnome/gnc-html-history.{h,c}: add destroy callback. part of
	report memory management cleanup

	* src/gnome/window-report.c: set report dirty flag when options
	apply or reload is clicked.  Store report object in window 
	struct while it's visible. 

	* src/scm/qif-import/qif-file.scm: expand detection of opening
	balance transactions.  

	* src/scm/qif-import/qif-parse.scm: fix regexp bug in miscincx and
	miscexpx category parsing (thanks carol!)

	* src/scm/qif-import/qif-to-gnc.scm: use correct amount for
	non-stock investment transactions (dividends etc).  Use fuzzy
	equality predicate for inexact numbers.

	* src/scm/report.scm: Add dirty flag and 'children' (other reports
	created by this report... nobody uses it yet) to report struct.
	Add function to clean up report when it's erased from the window
	history.  Add some debugging timing bits to the report-run
	function.  Display cached HTML if not dirty.   

	* src/scm/report.scm: WARNING! Change prototype of report
	rendering functions... they take a <report> object as argument
	instead of an options object.  This is necessary for memory
	management stuff when reports create other reports.

	* src/scm/report/account-summary.scm: fix to use new renderer
	signature

	* src/scm/report/average-balance.scm: fix to use new renderer
	signature

	* src/scm/report/hello-world.scm: fix to use new renderer
	signature

2001-01-30  Bill Gribble  <grib@billgribble.com>

	* src/scm/report/stylesheet-{plain,fancy}.scm: add a new boolean
	option to disable hyperlinks in reports.  This will make it nicer
	to have a "printing" style sheet that disables links when you want
	to print.  (if you change a report's style sheet, click "Reload"
	to see it take effect.  this needs to be fixed)

	* src/gnome/gnc-html-embedded.c: add support for URLsa attached to
	double clicks of pie slices, bar chart bars, and legend entries of
	guppi graphs.  Still need to do this for scatter chart.

	* src/scm/html-{piechart,barchart}.scm: add API for callbacks.
	Not totally finished with barchart yet.

	* src/scm/qif-import/qif-to-gnc.scm: check for currency and type
	mismatches between QIF-imported and existing GNC accounts.  If
	there's a name conflict, rename the new account with a unique name
	and a description indicating there was a conflict.  This should
	fix several reports of crashes for multi-currency users.

	* src/scm/report-utilities.scm: back out my previous breakage of
	gnc:amount->string

	* src/scm/report.scm: Thanks to the guile mailing list for
	pointing my at this odd bit of code needed to print backtraces on
	guile exceptions while still running.  You need to run with
	--debug to get the trace.
	
2001-01-26  Bill Gribble  <grib@billgribble.com>

	* src/gnome/gnc-gpg.{c,h}: if Linas can add useless prototype
	code, so can I :) Gnucash now supports display of GPG-encrypted
	HTML pages via another special <object> block.

	reporting to display errors from GHTTP if available. 

	* src/gnome/window-help.c: Add an Open button to open an arbitrary
	URL.  The network IS the computer!

	* src/scm/html-document.scm: Change interface to additional 
	attributes on html-document-markup-start. 

	* src/scm/html-table.scm: Fix rendering of <html-table-cell> to do
	rowspan/colspan correctly.  Add new constructors to build <th>
	<html-table-cells> in addition to <td>

	* src/scm/report-utilities.scm: Rename misnamed d-gnc:foo
	functions to gnc:foo.  d-gnc: is only for preexisting engine
	interface functions that had signature changes.  there's nothing
	inherently deprecated about using doubles in reports.

	* src/scm/report.scm: Start trying to print backtraces on
	exceptions in reports.  Only partially successful at this point;
	the error gets printed but the backtrace won't.  Stay tuned.  You
	need to run with --debug to see the error information.

	* src/scm/report/account-summary.scm: Modify to use new 
	table-cell ctors where appropriate.  Set justification for 
	cells correctly.

	Don't puke on unknown Action.

	* src/scm/qif-import/qif-dialog-utils.scm: Change default account
	for ShrsIn/ShrsOut to 'Retained Earnings', which is a normal
	account; replaces old policy of stock-denominated Equity
	subaccounts.
	
2001-01-15  Rob Browning  <rlb@cs.utexas.edu>

	* configure.in (G_WRAP_LINK_ARGS): require g-wrap 1.1.5.  This
	should fix a number of problems, including guile 1.3.4
	compatibility (g-wrap was using the *_NEWSMOB macros which guile
	1.3.4 doesn't have), and maybe even Dave's ugly memory issues.

	* src/scm/report/average-balance.scm: new g-wrap fix.
	Essentially all of these g-wrap fixes are to accomodate the new
	type names and visible bindings for g-wrapped non-native types.
	Where we had <gw:wct-void*> we now have <gw:void*>.  This naming
	convention has been applied unilaterally, even for native types,
	so we now have <gw:int>.  Further, types that are gnucash types
	appear as <gnc:Account*>, and types that are glib appear as
	<glib:GList*>, etc.  Finally, in cases where the name of the type
	is already prefixed with gnc, the prefix is not doubled, so we
	have gncSomeThing -> <gnc:SomeThing> and gnc-commodity* ->
	<gnc:commodity*>.

	* src/scm/report-utilities.scm
	(gnc:account-get-balance-at-date): new g-wrap fix.

	* src/guile/option-util.c
	(gnc_option_db_register_change_callback): new g-wrap fix.

	* src/guile/guile-util.c

	(gnc_copy_trans): new g-wrap fix.
	(gnc_copy_trans_scm_onto_trans_swap_accounts): new g-wrap fix.
	(gnc_glist_account_ptr_to_scm_internal): new g-wrap fix.
	(gnc_scm_to_commodity): new g-wrap fix.
	(gnc_commodity_to_scm): new g-wrap fix.
	(gnc_glist_commodity_ptr_to_scm): new g-wrap fix.

	* src/guile/gnucash.c.in (gnucash_main_helper): new g-wrap fix.

	* src/guile/gnc.gwp: major rework (mostly s///) for new g-wrap.

	* src/guile/gnc-helpers.c (gnc_scm_traversal_adapter): new g-wrap fix.

	* src/gnome/top-level.c (gnc_ui_show_main_window): new g-wrap fix.

	* src/doc/design/engine.texinfo (Splits): mention location of
	kvp_frame.txt -- the reserved key list.

	and editing HTML style sheets 

	* src/gnome/druid-qif-import.c: add support for false-if-exception
	error handling within QIF import process

	* src/gnome/gnc-html-embedded.c: add backslash escaping for

	mainwindow-account-tree in HTML (preliminary).  Add x axis 
	label rotation as an option to the barchart.

	* src/gnome/gnc-html.c: fixes for renaming of report objects and
	handling false-if-exception returns from report runs.  Use async
	mode for ghttp requests and add a gtk_timeout callback to check on
	their status.  Add a gnc_html_cancel() which gets rid of pending
	ghttp requests (called by the stop buttons in help, report
	windows)

	* src/gnome/window-help.c: bug fixes for search results printing.
	Don't expand help topics nodes on creation.  Add stop and reload

	QIF import entry points.

	* src/scm/report-utilities.scm: add functions to get immediate 
	subaccounts; rewrite get-balance-at-date.

	* src/scm/report.scm: rename report objects; now the thing that
	gets created by define-report is a <report-template> and the thing
	that has a window and a set of parameters is a <report>.  Add a
	"style sheet" option automatcally to EVERY report, and a "General"
	section to put it in; report with only 1 page of options should
	use "General".  Add false-if-exception error catching to report
	run.

	* src/scm/report/account-summary.scm, src/scm/report/hello-world.scm,
	src/scm/report/average-balance.scm: rewrite some reports using the
	new HTML generation infrastructure.  Old reports won't work until
	they are rewritten.

	* src/scm/report/stylesheet-*.scm (2 files): create some sample
	stylesheet templates.

	we're using gnome's now.  Add nifty features to help and 
	report windows.

	* src/gnome/dialog-options.c: redo to allow embedding in a

	* doc/html/C/guppi*.html: some simple demos of the guppi
	plot system.  You can get at them through the help topics
	browser.

	* build-help-index.pl : a dirt stupid HTML index builder. 
	Constructs a DB2 file from a list of input files. 

	* Add configure checks for guppi, libghttp

2000-11-09  Bill Gribble  <grib@billgribble.com>

	* src/engine/gnc_numeric.c: fix remainder-handling error

	stocks that are in the QIF files being loaded.

	* src/scm/qif-import/qif-file.scm: add progress bar to file read

	* src/scm/qif-import/qif-to-gnc.scm: add progress bar to 
	transaction mark and import.

2000-11-08  Bill Gribble  <grib@billgribble.com>

	* src/engine/SplitLedger.c: use new SetShareAmount/SetValue
	semantics (need to make sure this is correct!)

	* src/engine/Group.c: fix the "splits in GList with NULL data"
	problem.

	* src/engine/Transaction.c: get rid of Set***Directly functions,
	and modify the gnc_numeric versions of SetValue and SetShareAmount
	to use the direct semantics (i.e. SetValue doesn't affect the
	ShareAmount any more unless you use the deprecated double API).

	* src/engine/gnc-numeric.c: fix gnc_numeric_convert and
	double_to_gnc_numeric to ameliorate overflow problems.  This
	should fix the wrong balance problems people are seeing.

	* src/gnome/druid-qif-import.c: make selection persistent in
	account/cat pick lists

	* g-wrap gnc-numeric datatype and API; shuffle the Scheme API in
	the same way the C was done to add the new gnc-numeric API using
	the "real" function names and deprecate the old double API by
	prefixing the names with d-.  Now (for example)
	gnc:split-set-value takes a gnc_numeric arg, and
	d-gnc:split-set-value takes a double.  All calling scheme code was
	sed'ed to make this change.

	* src/scm/qif-import/qif-dialog-utils.scm: fix stock name regexp
	parsing bug in QIF importer.  This should fix the crash that many
	people have reported.

	* src/scm/qif-import/qif-file.scm: fix an Opening Balance
	processing bug that was causing some opening balance transactions
	to be duplicated.

	* src/scm/qif-import/qif-to-gnc.scm: fix double-counting of
	Commissions.  Change to use gnc_numeric and new Set semantics;
	this should (maybe) fix some reported off-by-a-penny problems.
	
2000-11-05  Rob Browning  <rlb@cs.utexas.edu>

	* src/engine/io-gncxml-w.c: sort commodities by namespace and id

2000-10-30  Dave Peticolas  <dave@krondo.com>

	* src/gnc-exp-parser.c: modify to use gnc_numerics instead of
	doubles.

	* src/engine/gnc-numeric.c: special case num == 0 to prevent
	divide by zero exception.

2000-10-27  Dave Peticolas  <dave@krondo.com>

	* src/calculation/expression_parser.c: handle (num) as -num.

2000-10-26  Dave Peticolas  <dave@krondo.com>

	* src/engine/util.c (DxaccParseAmount): handle (num) as -num.

2000-10-23  Rob Browning  <rlb@cs.utexas.edu>

	* src/scm/main.scm:
	(gnc:*batch-mode-things-to-do*): new var - keep track of startup bits.
	(gnc:main): add --load processing for "things-to-do".

	* src/scm/engine-utilities.scm:
	(gnc:filename->account-group): new - likely temporary.
	(gnc:call-with-account-data-from-file): new - likely temporary.

	* src/scm/command-line.scm (gnc:*arg-defs*): add --load option in
	addition to --evaluate.

	* src/engine/sql/PostgresBackend.c: handle changes in the rest of
	the code.

	* src/engine/kvp_frame.c: change the datatype a little to pull the
	union tag into the main struct.  Also update the functions and
	datatypes to more closely mirror glib types.  i.e. lists are now
	just GLists that must contain only kvp_value pointers.  The kvp
	docs have *not* been updated to reflect these changes (nor the
	changes listed below).
	(kvp_frame_set_slot): now setting a slot to a NULL value deletes
	the slot.  This is not in the docs yet.
	(init_frame_body_if_needed): new function - only initialize the
	guts of the kvp_frame if we need them.  This helps in some
	situations and should be free otherwise.  All the other functions
	should handle this properly now.
	(kvp_value_new_binary_nc): new function - create a new binary
	object using the pointer given directly.
	(kvp_frame_for_each_slot): new function.
	(kvp_value_compare): new function.
	(kvp_frame_compare): new function.

	* src/engine/kvp_frame.h: accomodate changes to kvp_frame.c.
	
	* src/engine/guid.c:
	(guid_compare): new function.
	(guid_hash_to_guint): hash function from glib.
	(guid_hash_table_new): new function.
	(guid_g_hash_table_equal): new function.

	* src/engine/guid.h: accomodate changes to guid.c.

	* src/engine/date.c:
	(timespec_equal): new function.

	* src/engine/date.c: accomodate changes to date.c.
	
	* src/engine/Transaction.c: update all functions to mark the
	account's dirty flags when needed.
	(xaccTransGetSlot): deleted - replaced by xaccTransGetSlots.
	(xaccTransSetSlot): deleted - replaced by xaccTransGetSlots.
	(xaccTransGetSlots): new function.
	(xaccTransEqual): new function.
	(DATE_CMP): don't use pointer to pointer args (unnecessary).
	(xaccSplitDateOrder): now a total order - sort on guid if needed.
	(xaccSplitOrder): deleted - unused.
	(xaccTransOrder): now a total order - sort on guid if needed.
	(xaccTransSetDocref): deleted.
	(xaccTransGetDocref): deleted.

	* src/engine/Transaction.h: accomodate changes to Transaction.c.

	* src/engine/TransactionP.h: accomodate changes to Transaction.c.
	
	* src/engine/Session.c:
	(xaccSessionGetFileError): new function - migrate away from using
	global for error status.
	(xaccSessionBegin): change semantics - a begin does *not* load the
	file automatically now.  You must call xaccSessionLoad for that.
	This is better, particularly in the SaveAs case when the load is
	wasteful, and, until we fix the GUID code up so that loading the
	same file twice doesn't cause a detonation, safer.
	(xaccSessionBegin): change semantics - same as for
	xaccSessionBegin.
	(xaccSessionLoad): new function - loads the session data.
	(xaccSessionSaveMayClobberData): new function - predicate.
	(xaccSessionSave): change semantics - don't delete the file if
	topgroup is NULL.  This is too scary given all the other changes.
	We can bring it back later if needed, but I'd probably rather see
	an xaccSessionPurgeStorage, or similar.
	
	* src/engine/Session.h: support changes to Session.c.

	* src/engine/Makefile.am: handle new, deleted, and renamed files.

	* src/engine/Group.c: handle vanished account id's, etc.
	(xaccGroupEqual): new function.
	(xaccGroupVisitUnvisitedTransactions): new function.
	(xaccGroupForEachTransaction): new function.
	(xaccGroupMapAccounts): new function (probably going away later).
	(xaccGroupForEachAccountDeeply): ditto.

	* src/engine/Group.h: handler changes to Acccount*'s and to Group.c.

	* src/engine/GNCId.c:
	(xaccGetAndResetEntityTable): new function - needed when you want
	to load two files representing the same data for
	comparison.
	(xaccSetEntityTable): new function - needed when you want
	to load two files representing the same data for
	comparison.

	* src/engine/GNCIdP.h: accomodate changes to GNCId.c

	* src/engine/Account.c: many changes, removed some unused fields,
	changed Account's to have a GList of splits rather than a NULL
	terminated array of pointers - allowed optimizing several things
	and made the code cleaner in spots.
	(xaccAccountBeginEdit): remove defer argument - difficult to
	handle with nesting - may add later if really needed.  Change this
	and
	(xaccAccountCommitEdit): to handle nesting.  Fix up all setter
	routines to respect Begin/Commit, including ones for splits over
	in Transaction.c.
	(xaccInitAccount): Add/use sort_dirty and balance_dirty flags.
	Change kvp_data to always be initialized (also changed kvp_frames
	to be lighter weight when empty).
	(xaccAccountEqual): new function.
	(xaccSortSplits): new function.
	(xaccAccountBringUpToDate): new function.
	(xaccAccountGetSlot): deleted - replaced by xaccAccountGetSlots
	(xaccAccountSetSlot): deleted - replaced by xaccAccountGetSlots
	(xaccAccountGetSlots): new function - returns kvp_frame.
	(xaccAccountGetID): deleted - accounts no longer have IDs.
	(xaccAccountGetID): deleted - accounts no longer have flags.
	(xaccAccountCheckDateOrder): renamed to xaccAccountFixSplitDateOrder.
	(xaccCheckTransDateOrder): renamed to xaccTransFixSplitDateOrder.
	(xaccAccountSetNotes): notes now stored in slot "notes".
	(xaccAccountGetNotes): ditto.
	(xaccAccountTypeEnumAsString): new function - required by text IO.
	(xaccAccountStringToType): new function - required by text IO.
	(xaccAccountSetPriceSrc): prices now stored in slot "old-price-source".
	(xaccAccountGetPriceSrc): ditto.
	(xaccAccountVisitUnvisitedTransactions): new function.
	(xaccAccountForEachTransaction): new function.
	
	* src/engine/Account.h: changes to accomodate above changes to
	Account.c.

	* src/engine/Account.h: changes to accomodate above changes to
	Account.c.

	* src/engine/io-gncxml-r.c: new xml format reader.  This has a
	semi-abstract incremental configurable low-ish memory XML tree
	parser inside which should later be broken out into a separate
	file.

	* src/engine/io-gncxml-w.c: new xml format writer.  This is pretty
	straightforward, but due to limitations in libxml, has large
	memory requirements.  It has to build the entire XML tree in RAM
	before it writes anything.

	* src/engine/io-gncxml.h: new file - the current XML handling does
	*not* have any transparent file compression.  Expect that soon -
	it doesn't make the performance any worse (thank goodness).

	* src/engine/io-gncbin-r.c: renamed from src/engine/FileIO.c.
	Only the reader is still active.  All writing is as XML now.

	* src/engine/io-gncbin.h: renamed from src/engine/FileIO.h.

	* src/engine/FileIO.c: new file - now the meta-level file that has
	functions that handle the various underlying file types.  Any old
	docref fields are stored in an "old-docref" slot and any old price
	sources are stored in an "old-price-source" slot.  Handle the fact
	that account id's are gone.

	* src/engine/FileIO.h: new file.

	* make-gnucash-patch.in: ignore some more autogen files.

	* src/FileDialog.c: update to handle new Session* semantics.
	Saving and SavingAs are not the same anymore, session-wise.  We
	don't perform a pointless (and GUID dangerous) load before we
	SaveAs.

	* Many changes, not all of which will be documented right now.
	This patch must get out.  I'll come back and fix this up later.
	The highlights are...

2000-10-16  Bill Gribble  <grib@billgribble.com>

	* Patch for new numeric representation, new commodity 
	  representation, and rewritten QIF importer.  

	  - numeric format: the engine's internal representation of values
	  changed from 'double' to 'gnc-numeric', an exact number format.
	  see src/doc/gnc-numeric.txt.  This patch is step 1; the old
	  'double' engine API remains, but the names have been changed
	  from (for example) xaccSplitSetValue to DxaccSplitSetValue. The
	  D means deprecated.  Will be gradually migrating the usage of
	  doubles to gnc-numeric throughout gnucash, eventually removing
	  the Dxacc API completely.  ATM, there is no scheme support for
	  gnc-numeric, so I just left the Scheme API alone (old function
	  names still work, and work the same way).

	  - commodity representation: up to now, the engine has just used
	  strings to represent currencies.  Now we use a struct
	  'gnc-commodity', which has more information about the
	  currency/stock/commodity than its name, including what exchange
	  it trades on and what the resolution of transactions is in
	  fractional units.  When you read in an old gnucash file, you
	  will get a 'wizard' that will ask questions about the currencies
	  and stocks in your old file.

	  - QIF importer: I redid the GUI to be more of a wizard style.
	  This should get rid of a lot of people's problems using it since
	  it's more step-by-step oriented.

	* src/scm/qif-import/qif-to-gnc.scm: set Reconcile correctly.
	Also numerous other small changes.

	* src/scm/qif-import/qif-parse.scm: handle 20000101 date formats
	and MiscExpX category lines correctly.

	* src/scm/qif-import/qif-file.scm: correctly handle ambiguous 
	date format by asking the right answer.

	* src/scm/qif-import/qif-dialog-utils.scm: use the correct account
	separator char for automatically created accounts 

	* src/scm/hooks.scm: added a file-opened-hook that gets run 
	any time a gnucash file is opened.  

	* src/engine/gnc-engine.{c,h}: new files for global engine
	meta-operations.  I mainly needed it to add a global list of known
	'commodities' (currencies, stocks, etc), but there's now an
	gnc-engine-init function called at startup with settable hooks.

	* src/gnome/dialog-account.c: add "select" buttons for account
	security and currency.  Still need to make "smallest currency
	unit" configurable per-account, but need to fix common-currency
	problem first.

	* src/gnome/dialog-find-transactions.c: use gnc_dateentry widget

	* src/engine/Translog.c: warning! log format for numbers is 
	now "%Ld/%Ld", numerator/denominator.

	* src/engine/Query.c: change date query functions to be more
	useful.  Start and end dates are optionally ignored, making it 
	possible to say "any date before.." or "any date after.." 

	
2000-09-16  Dave Peticolas  <dave@krondo.com>

	* src/register/table-allgui.c: re-implement using gtables.

	* src/register/cellblock.c: re-implement using gtables.

	* src/register/gtable.c: implentation of a dynamic 2-d array.

	* src/engine/Transaction.h: make xaccInitTransaction a private
	function.

	* src/scm/qif-import/qif-to-gnc.scm: Don't init a new transaction.
	gnc:transaction-create does this automatically. Doing it again leaks
	memory.

2000-09-11  Dave Peticolas  <dave@krondo.com>

	* src/gnome/dialog-transfer.c: incorporate amount editing widget
	into the transfer dialog.

	* src/scm/report/*.scm: Modified date options to take the new
	function.  Most are still using absolute options at this stage,
	will get modified to use relative dates later.

	* src/scm/options.scm (gnc:make-option): new argument
	(option-data-fns) for manipulating multi-choice style options.

	sure it's a timepair before doing conversion.

	* src/gnome/dialog-options.c: Extensive changes to support relative

	here.
	(gnc:group-map-accounts): moved here.

	* src/scm/command-line.scm (gnc:*arg-defs*): add --evaluate
	option.  This should be considered beta, and it's not documented
	yet, but it's useful for me right now, we need something like it,
	and I'd like others to see what they think.  Also, this will only
	work right when I finish fixing up tip-of-the-day to not
	initialize when the file loads.

	accelerators as the register date cell.

2000-07-03  Robert Graham Merkel  <rgmerk@mira.net>

2000-06-28  Robert Graham Merkel  <rgmerk@mira.net>

	* src/gnome/dialog-totd.c: If somebody tries to open a second

	cell.

	* src/SplitLedger.c: modify for the changes in the reconcile cell.

	* src/register/recncell.c: make the reconcile cell a real object,
	not just a BasicCell with some extra functions. Add functionality
	for distinguishing between the flag value and the displayed value.

2000-06-26  Dave Peticolas  <dave@krondo.com>

	* src/gnome/dialog-utils.c (gnc_get_reconcile_str): new function.
	Return i18n'd string for reconciled flag.

	* src/gnome/reconcile-list.c: use i18n'd reconciled flag string.

	* src/scm/tip-of-the-day.scm: put the check for whether tips
	should be shown or not inside the hook. We can't do the check
	here because the options haven't been loaded yet.

	* src/scm/options.scm: fix bug in writing options. Use 'write'
	to output section and option names for proper escaping.

2000-06-27  Robert Graham Merkel  <rgmerk@mira.net>

	the scheme tip of the day engine.

	* src/guile/option-util.[ch] (gnc_option_db_set_boolean_option):
	New function to set a boolean option.
	
	* src/scm/tip-of-the-day.scm: New file: an interface for reading
	in and passing tips to the gui in text form.

	* src/scm/tip-list.scm: A list of tips as a Scheme list.  File
	should probably be shifted somewhere else.

	* src/scm/startup.scm: Loads tip-of-the-day.scm

	* src/scm/prefs.scm: Add an option for displaying tips of the day
	at startup.  Also added gnc:support line.

2000-06-23  Dave Peticolas  <dave@krondo.com>

	* src/gnome/dialog-utils.c (gnc_window_adjust_for_screen): new

	* doc/html/C/xacc-about.html: update last version info

	* src/guile/gnucash.c.in: update last version info

2000-06-21  Dave Peticolas  <dave@krondo.com>

	* src/register/splitreg.h: break out the register type and the

	remove the -stat argument, it's no longer support in later swig
	versions.

	* src/register/Makefile.am: don't compile table-html.c, it is
	not needed for linking.

	* src/gnome/window-register.c: remove include of table-html.c

	* src/engine/gnc-common.h: use 'gboolean' to typedef gncBoolean.
	We should probably just phase out the use of gncBoolean.

2000-06-20  Dave Peticolas  <dave@krondo.com>

	* src/engine/util.c (xaccParseAmount): accept 8 decimal places
	instead of 6, and trucate if more than 8.

	* src/gnome/dialog-add.c: make this window modeless.
	(gnc_ui_accWindow_ok_cb): don't let the user add an account with

2000-06-19  Dave Peticolas  <dave@krondo.com>

	* src/guile/gnc.gwp: take out GUIDs for Groups.

	* src/engine/Group.c: take out GUIDs for Groups. Groups are really
	just lists with no additional structure, and giving them GUIDs
	complicates matters without adding any utility. You can always use
	the parent account GUID instead.

	* src/gnome/top-level.c: configure list auto-popping from here.

	* src/register/gnome/combocell-gnome.c: determine whether or not
	to auto-pop lists based on a class variable, and not by looking
	up the guile function. This removes a src/guile dependency from
	src/register/gnome.

2000-06-14  Dave Peticolas  <dave@krondo.com>

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-item-edit.c (item_edit_show_list):
	make sure the current selected item is visible and, before doing
	so, process all pending events to make sure the list is shown and
	sized first.

2000-06-13  Dave Peticolas  <dave@krondo.com>

	* src/SplitLedger.c: refresh the main window before refreshing the
	register. This makes sure balances are recomputed first.

	* src/engine/Transaction.c (xaccSplitSetBaseValue): mark the split
	as having changed.

	* src/gnome/gnc-currency-edit.c: loosen the restrictions on what
	can be typed in. The 'currency' could potentially be a stock
	symbol.

2000-06-12  Dave Peticolas  <dave@krondo.com>

	* src/gnome/dialog-transfer.c: don't use 'Categories', it's a
	confusing term.

	* src/SplitLedger.c (LedgerAutoCompletion): open transaction
	without deferring rebalancing.

2000-06-09  Robert Graham Merkel  <rgmerk@mira.net>

	* src/scm/report/transaction-report.scm (): commented out
	"merged" style because of conflict with double-column amounts.

2000-06-08  Robert Graham Merkel  <rgmerk@mira.net>

	* src/scm/report/average-balance.scm (average-balance-renderer): 
	added a condition to catch incorrectly entered dates without crashing.

2000-06-07  Dave Peticolas  <dave@krondo.com>

	* src/engine/Query.c: fixed a "dave is an idiot" bug in cropping
	the split list.

	* src/gnome/window-register.c (gnc_register_create_menu_bar): don't
	use stock close menu -- it's for closing files not closing windows.

	* src/gnome/dialog-add.c (gnc_ui_accWindow_create_account): don't
	make an opening balance transaction.

	* src/SplitLedger.c: use value, not share amount, for debit/credit
	cells in equity registers.

	* src/gnome/dialog-utils.c (gnc_ui_install_field_strings): set the
	code even if it's blank. Auto-coding doesn't work right now.

2000-06-06  Dave Peticolas  <dave@krondo.com>

	* src/SplitLedger.c (LedgerTraverse): use correct argument for
	exact_cell to gnc_table_find_valid_cell_horiz.
	(LedgerMoveCursor): ditto.

	* src/register/splitreg.c (xaccInitSplitRegister): Don't blank
	zeros in the price cell.

	* src/guile/gfec.c: fix bugs in usage of internal guile functions.
	more cleanup.

2000-06-05  Dave Peticolas  <dave@krondo.com>

	* src/register/splitreg.c (xaccInitSplitRegister): use higher
	precision for stock prices.

	* src/<lots>: moved gui-dependent definitions from
	src/engine/gnc-common.h to src/engine/gnc-ui-common.h.
	Use guint32 instead of home-grown typedef. This touched
	many files.

	* src/guile/guile-util.c (gnc_get_debit_string): make sure to
	return a malloc'd string.

	* src/register/splitreg.c (configLabels): check for NULL strings
	from the label getters.

	* src/gnome/window-register.c (gnc_register_date_window): if 'show
	all transactions' is not set in the preferences, limit it to
	30. Temporary fix for 1.4, this should be configurable.

	* configure.in: changed '! test' to 'test !'.

	* src/engine: removed *Consolidate* functions. These were cruft
	used by the old QIFIO routines.

2000-06-04  Dave Peticolas  <dave@krondo.com>

	* src/engine/util.c: add log level modification functions.

	* src/scm/command-line.scm: add a --loglevel argument to set the
	logging level.

	* */Makefile.am and others: fix up make dist to build a full-blown
	tarfile.

2000-06-04  Dave Peticolas  <dave@krondo.com>

	* src/engine/Session.c (xaccSessionSave): record file writing errors
	in the session error code.

	* src/FileDialog.c (gncFileSave): print an error message in a dialog

	original copy, make sure it's still the same as the old value,
	modulo case.

2000-06-03  Dave Peticolas  <dave@krondo.com>

	* src/engine/FileIO.c: John Goerzen's patch for 64-bit
	architectures.

	return from gnc:group-get-account-list.

	* src/scm/engine-utilities.scm (gnc:group-get-account-list):

2000-05-31  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/register/splitreg.c (configLabels): label the straight xfer
	and xfer to cells as 'Account', label the mirrored xfer as just
	'Transfer'.

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-header.c
	(gnucash_header_reconfigure): also redraw if the style changes.

2000-05-30  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/register/quickfillcell.c: if a quickfill attempt fails,
	replace the string with the original case string.

2000-05-29  Robert Graham Merkel  <rgmerk@mira.net>

	* src/scm/report/transaction-report-2.scm (make-account-subheading): 
	added the ability to display balances at start-of-report date
	when sorting by accounts.  Also replaced gnc:split-get-amount
	(which doesn't exist) with gnc:split-get-value for amount sorting.

	* doc/guile-hackers.txt: Added pointers to g-wrap now that it's
	not part of the main gnucash distribution.

2000-05-24  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/SplitLedger.c: some simplification, some additional
	complexity :) Fixed a crash-bug with traversing out of the
	pending transaction and rolling it back. Fixed traversal out
	of the blank line of a multi-split transaction that has been
	edited.

2000-05-23  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/engine: removed QIF routines from the engine.

	* src/scm/options.scm: add a currency option type.

	* src/gnome/dialog-options.c: add support for currency options.

	* src/gnome/dialog-utils.c (gnc_ui_account_field_box_create): used
	the new currency editor widget.

	* src/gnome/gnc-currency-edit.c: new widget for picking currencies.

2000-05-22  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/guile/guile-util.c (gnc_depend): new function to access the
	gnc:depend guile function.

2000-05-21  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

2000-05-20  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/engine/Account.c (xaccAccountRecomputeBalance): added share,
	cleared share, and reconciled share balance tracking, along with
	api calls for getting them.

	* src/engine/Transaction.c: add calls to get share cleared and
	reconciled balance.

	* src/engine/Query.c: use g_list_prepend and then reverse when
	gathering splits. When pruning the list, prune from the beginning,
	not the end, per the original semantics. Handle the case when
	q->max_splits is 0.

	* src/gnome/dialog-add.c (accWindow): if the window is closed as a
	result of a gnome_dialog_close, don't save the size or destroy the
	window, it's already gone.

	* configure.in: remove check for readline. guile-config should
	return the right values. Also, change LOCALE_DIR definition to
	$datadir/locale. This seems to be more correct.

	* src/swig/perl5/Makefile.in: use -fPIC because it's needed on
	sparcs and doesn't seem to hurt for others.

	* src/gnome/window-register.c (gnc_register_sort): just sort by the
	given key and then by the standard order.

	* src/gnome/window-reconcile.c: add menus to change the sort order

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-style.c (gnucash_style_init): use
	default style's font. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a
	way to get a default italic font, so use the regular one for now.

	* src/gnome/reconcile-list.c: use Queries to get the splits so
	we can do sorting. Add an api call to change the sort order.

	* src/engine/Query.c (xaccAmountMatchPredicate): debits are
	positive, credits are negative.

	* Makefile.in: install files and directories one at a time. If the
	user does not have an install script, the one supplied in the
	gnucash distribution can only handle one file at a time.

	* src/engine/util.c (xaccParseAmount): allow negative sign to be
	at the front or back of the amount.

2000-05-18  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	value, redraw.

2000-05-17  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/engine/Query.c: allow sorting by reconciled date and
	reconcile status.

	* src/gnome/window-reconcile.c: add a 'statement date' to the
	reconciliation date. This date is used to set all the reconcile
	dates of the splits that get reconciled.

	* src/engine/Transaction.c (xaccSplitSetReconcile): don't change
	the reconcile date when the reconcile status is changed.

2000-05-18  Robert Graham Merkel  <rgmerk@mira.net>

	* src/scm/report/transaction-report-2.scm: Fixed *some* of the
	bugs with two-column balance displays.

2000-05-17  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/gnome/window-reconcile.c (gnc_recn_create_tool_bar): add a
	'Finish' reconcile button to the toolbar.

	* src/register/splitreg.c (configLabels): use callbacks to get
	debit/credit headings.

	* src/guile/guile-util.c: new functions to access guile
	debit/credit synonyms by account type.

	* src/scm/prefs.scm: added debit/credit synonym configuration.

2000-05-16  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/engine/guid/guid.h: change the GUID struct to a union with
	an integer to force 32-bit alignment on systems that need it.

	* src/register/splitreg.c (xaccInitSplitRegister): in a currency
	register, set the is_currency flag on the price cell.

	* src/register/pricecell.c (xaccSetPriceCellIsCurrency): function
	to set printing of currency prices in price cells.

	* src/engine/util.c (xaccSPrintAmount): added a PRTCUR flag for
	printing currency prices. Changed flags type from short to unsigned
	int with a typedef of GNCPrintAmountFlags. Changed other files to
	reflect this.

	* src/scm/report/balance-and-pnl.scm: fix html error (fix from
	Martin Schwenke).

	* src/guile/guile-util.c: many bug fixes.

	* src/scm/engine-interface.scm: fix list-ref arg order bug.

	* src/SplitLedger.c (xaccSRCountRows): fix a bug when a two or
	more splits from the same transaction are in the same account. Fix
	other bugs including not accessing deleted splits/transactions.
	Improve the refresh strategy. Could this code get any more
	complicated? Yes...

2000-05-15  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/register/splitreg.c (xaccSplitRegisterGetCursorTypeRowCol):
	new function, get cursor type by virt row/col.

	* src/scm/report/transaction-report.scm: debits on left, credits
	on right.

	* src/engine/guid/md5.c (md5_process_bytes): fix 32-bit alignment
	bug.

	src/scm/engine-interface.scm.

	* src/Refresh.c (gnc_account_glist_ui_refresh): added a refresh
	function that takes glib lists. Much more convenient.

	* src/SplitLedger.c: add functionality for transaction
	cut/copy/paste.

	* src/MultiLedger.c (ledgerIsMember): always return true
	for SEARCH_LEDGERS. Simple, but safe.

	* Makefile.common (CFLAGS): removed hard-coded profiling option

	* configure.in: add a profiling argument.

	* src/guile/gnucash.c: use putenv, not setenv. putenv is POSIX,

	* many: removed use of SCM registry in favor of scm_protect_object
	and scm_unprotect_object.

	before inserting.

2000-05-08  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/engine/GNCId.c (xaccGUIDNew): new function to generate
	IDs for gnucash. Use this, not guid_new. Also modified other
	engine files to use this function.

	* src/register/pricecell.c (COLORIZE): check for being close to
	zero before colorizing red.

	* src/scm/main.scm (gnc:main): if no filename was specified, open
	the most recent file in the history.

2000-04-15  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-style.c (gnucash_style_layout_init):
 	added a missing 'break' statement.

2000-04-14  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/engine/AccInfo.c: allow the price source to be set to NULL.

	* lots of build system files: changes for the global id stuff.

	* src/engine/GNCId.c: engine globally unique id api implementation.

	* src/engine/guid/md5.c: taken from GNU textutils.

	globally unique ids.

2000-04-10  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* doc/README: only the environment variable LANG needs to
	be set to change the locale.

2000-04-09  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/scm/srfi/srfi-1.r5rs.scm: renamed 'list-index' to
 	'list-index-pred'. guile-1.3.4 defines a list-index with
	different api and semantics.

	* configure.in: make gnucash.spec configured

	* rpm/gnucash.spec.in: new file, same as old gnucash.spec, but
	with @VERSION@ instead of a hard-coded version number. Removed
	gnucash.spec.

	* src/scm/prefs.scm: make the default field types be description
 	and total

	* src/gnome/window-main.c (gnc_configure_account_tree): set the
	state of the total field

	* src/gnome/account-tree.c: add in the new total field

	* src/gnome/dialog-utils.c: add the new account field key
 	ACCOUNT_TOTAL. This key refers to the account's balance plus the
 	balances of all children. The ACCOUNT_BALANCE key now refers to
 	the balance of the account itself, without children.

2000-04-08  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/scm/report/balance-and-pnl.scm: remove the report description.
	It just looked weird!

	* src/scm/command-line.scm (gnc:prefs-show-version): use the
	configured version instead of hard-coding it.

	* src/scm/bootstrap.scm.in (gnc:version): configure this guile
	variable with the gnucash version info.

	* src/SplitLedger.c (xaccLoadXferCell): == not = Doh!!!

2000-04-07  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/engine/Query.c (PROLOG): move declaration of da and db
	locals into the macros that actually use them. This gets rid
	of some annoying warnings.

	* src/register/numcell.c: added method to set the last number
 	entered.  The next number entered is now the last number + 1.

	* Makefile.in: changed [ -e filename ] to [ -f filename ]

	* src/scm/report.scm: Changed the report format to be a record.

2000-04-05  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	in auto-mode where the current transaction has been deleted.

	* src/scm/report/balance-and-pnl.scm: put sub-accouts below their
	parent accounts and indent their names. Align the columns better.
	Print fully-qualified names.

2000-04-04  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-style.c: update the styles
 	appropriately for the changes below.

	* src/register/splitreg.c: configure the ledger style register
	with a xfer to field in all modes.

	* src/SplitLedger.c (xaccSRLoadRegister): remove stock price hack.
	many code cleanups throughout file.

2000-04-03  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/gnome/window-register.c: changed menu definitions to be
	statically allocated.
	* src/gnome/window-main.c: ditto

	* src/SplitLedger.c: added extra checks for boundary conditions.
	When refreshing, try to go to the same cell offset as before.

2000-04-01  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/SplitLedger.c: more generalizations needed for general
 	ledger operation.

	* src/register/splitreg.c (configLayout): add the xto cell into
	the transaction cursor.

2000-03-31  Rob Browning  <rlb@cs.utexas.edu>

 	* lib/Makefile.in: re-configure g-wrap after every distclean and
 	rebuild/install it on every build.

 	* gnucash: fix the doc-path to match the new structure.  This
 	fixes things back the way they were, but now we need to add
 	runtime locale detection.

 	* doc/build-system: new file - should eventually cover
 	build-system info and justifications.

 	* configure.in: changes to accomodate the new GNC_EXPANDED_*
 	vars.  See doc/build-system for a summary.

 	* Makefile.init.in (ABSOLUTE_TOP_SRCDIR): set
 	(top_srcdir): don't set (it has to be set in each separate Makefile.in)

 	* Makefile.config.finish: deleted.

 	* Makefile.in: minor cleanup -- some safety checks.

 	* Makefile.common: Clear all the .SUFFIXES rules.  They were
 	causing weird behaviors when I was trying to create some new

 	gnc:support calls. 

 	* src/scm/printing/print-check.scm: scope gnc:depend and

 	gnc:support calls. 

 	* src/scm/main.scm: fix load-path problems.

2000-03-31  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/gnome/window-register.c (gnc_transaction_delete_query): ok, we
	can't destroy the dialog on close, because we need the widgets to be
	there afterwards. gtk_widget_destroy() the dialog instead.

	* src/register/splitreg.c: add a SEARCH_LEDGER register type. Don't
	include the balance field in 'ledger' style registers.

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-style.c (gnucash_style_layout_init):
 	new layouts for ledgers -- they don't have a balance field. We'll
 	probably need to redo them if we add a xto field. Broke out the
	actual layout construction into separate functions.

2000-03-30  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/SplitLedger.c (xaccSRSaveRegEntry): remove the 'special
 	case' for setting the price. It is no longer needed.

	* src/gnome/window-register.c (gnc_reg_set_window_name): set the
 	name regardless of whether there is a leader.

	* src/SplitLedger.c (xaccSRLoadRegister): fixed a possible memory
 	leak in destroying the buffer

2000-03-29  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/scm/report/transaction-report.scm: bug fixes and speed
 	improvements

	* src/engine/Group.c: added some new transaction traversal code

	* src/scm/report/folio.scm: implement the old eperl report

2000-03-28  Robert Graham Merkel  <rgmerk@mira.net>

 	* man/gnc-prices.1: new file.  Man page for gnc-prices. Somebody
 	please add installation from makefile!

2000-03-27  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/scm/report/budget-report.scm: removed use of transaction
 	report function. This was generating a value that was not
 	subsequently used.

2000-03-26  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/scm/report/transaction-report.scm: i18n the report

	* src/gnome/window-register.c (gnc_transaction_delete_query):
 	destroy on close, don't hide.

	* src/register/splitreg.c: several new functions for saving and
	restore the contents of the cursor.

	* src/SplitLedger.c (xaccSRRedrawRegEntry): always redraw, caller
 	knows best!
	(LedgerMoveCursor): if we are leaving the pending transaction,
 	commit it.
	(xaccSRLoadRegister): save and restore changed cursor values.
	(xaccSRSaveRegEntry): clear the register change flags.

2000-03-24  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/register/gnome/quickfillcell-gnome.c (QuickFillDirect): if
 	the cursor is in the selection, move it to the start of the
 	selection.

	* Makefile.common: add the value of DEFS to the compile flags

	* Makefile.init.in: get the value for DEFS.

	* src/register/numcell.c: new cell for entering numbers. Handles
	accelerators for increasing/decreasing the number and remembers
	the largest number for auto-filling.

2000-03-23  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/scm/report/average-balance.scm: fixed many things and i18n'd
	the report.

	* src/engine/util.c (PrintAmt): always use '.' as the decimal point
	coming from sprintf.

2000-03-22  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/scm/prefs.scm: set the default currency code using the
	wrapped C function in util.c below.

	* src/engine/util.c (xaccSPrintAmount): add a PRTNMN flag for
 	printing non-monetary values.
	(gnc_locale_default_currency): return the currency code for the
 	current locale.

	* src/register/splitreg.c (xaccInitSplitRegister): update for
 	changes to the price cell api.

	* src/engine/util.c (xaccSPrintAmount): set the precision based on
 	the locale.

	* src/register/pricecell.c: remove some unneeded api calls and
	add one for specifying that the cell contains a share quantity.

2000-03-19  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/gnome/dialog-options.c (gnc_option_set_ui_widget): request
	a reasonable size for the number-range widget.

	* src/FileDialog.c (gncFileQuerySave): return a boolean value
 	indicating whether the user wants to proceed or cancel. The uses
 	of this function have been updated to respond appropriately.

2000-03-18  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/engine/Query.c (xaccInitQuery): make the standard engine
 	order the default sort order.

	* src/gnome/window-adjust.c (adjBRefresh): update the title

	* src/Refresh.c (gnc_account_ui_refresh): refresh the edit account
	and adjust balance windows too.

	* src/engine/Account.c (xaccAccountSetType): allow account types
 	to be changed.

2000-03-15  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/scm/extensions.scm (gnc:new-menu-namer): register and
 	translate the names correctly.

	* src/scm/report.scm (gnc:report-menu-setup win): make sure the
 	report title gets registered and translated.

	* src/scm/report/hello-world.scm: i18n'd this report.

2000-03-14  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-sheet.c
 	(gnucash_register_key_press_cb): generate activate event on a
 	keypad enter as well as the return key.

	* Docs/C/xacc-ticker.html: updated for Yahoo Europe information.

2000-03-13  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/gnome/dialog-utils.c: added Yahoo Europe to the quote source
 	menu.

	* src/quotes/Quote.pm: added method for getting Yahoo European
 	quotes. Also, fixed the parsing of csv data.

	* src/quotes/gnc-prices: cleanup the code, less wordy output.

	* src/quotes/Quote.pm (yahoo): updates from latest YahooQuote.pm

2000-03-12  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/scm/c-interface.scm (gnc:error->string tag args): print a
 	stack backtrace.

	* src/gnome/cursors.c: when given a NULL argument, the set and
	unset busy cursor function change all top-level window cursors.
	This breaks the motif side though, in that the cursor will no
	longer get set there. Oh well.

	* src/gnome/window-register.c (duplicateCB): new callback for
 	duplicating the current transaction/split.

	* src/SplitLedger.c (xaccSRDuplicateCurrent): new function to
 	duplicate the current split or transaction.

	* src/gnome/window-report.c (gnc_run_report): set the busy cursor
	while running the report generator.

2000-03-10  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/gnome/window-main.c (gnc_ui_refresh_statusbar): revise the
 	profit and asset calculation.

	* src/MultiLedger.c (xaccLedgerDisplayRefresh): don't reverse the
 	balances ever -- let the GUI do it.

	* src/motif/RegWindow.c (regRefresh): reverse the balances
	for INCOME and expense.

2000-03-09  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

 	reversed-balanced account balances appropriately.

2000-03-07  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/scm/report/transaction-report.scm: a few bug fixes.

	* src/gnome/window-main.c (gnc_ui_delete_account): destroy the
 	windows *then* remove the account from the tree. Sometimes,
 	destroying the window can result in a refresh, which will do
 	strange things if we have already removed the account from the
 	tree.

2000-03-06  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/gnome/window-reconcile.c (recnRefresh): resize the window

	* src/FileDialog.c (gncPostFileOpen): set the busy cursor while
 	reading the file.
	(gncFileSave): ditto.

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-sheet.c
 	(gnucash_sheet_update_adjustments): set the step increment.

2000-03-06  Heath Martin  <martinh@pegasus.cc.ucf.edu>

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-style.c
 	(gnucash_sheet_style_set_col_width): Adjust the overall style
 	width, too.

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-header.c
 	(gnucash_header_auto_resize_column): Resize the window to fit the
 	register.
	(gnucash_header_event): ditto on a column resize.

2000-03-05  Rob Browning  <rlb@cs.utexas.edu>

	* src/scm/report/transaction-report.scm: add support for depend
	mechanism.

	* src/scm/report/hello-world.scm: add support for depend
	mechanism.

	* src/scm/report/folio.scm: add support for depend mechanism.

	* src/scm/report/balance-and-pnl.scm: add support for depend
	mechanism.

	* src/scm/report/average-balance.scm: add support for depend
	mechanism.

	* src/scm/report.scm (gnc:report-menu-setup): fixed minor
	non-r5rsism (defines must be at the beginning of a <body>).

	* src/scm/report/report-list.scm: new file.  This is where all of
	the reports that should be loaded at startup should be listed.

	* src/scm/main.scm (gnc:startup): don't autoscan/load from the
	report dir anymore.  Use the depend mechanism instead.  This isn't
	as convenient, but it's safer.

	* src/scm/hooks.scm (gnc:hook-run-danglers): added a little
	debugging code.

	* src/scm/extensions.scm (gnc:extensions-menu-setup): fixed minor
	non-r5rsism (nested defines must be at the beginning of a <body>).

	* make-gnucash-patch: allow the user to override the default
	locations with environment variables.

2000-03-04  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/guile/gnucash.c (main): load the locale from the environment
 	with setlocale. This is needed so that guile can find the locale.

	* Docs/: reorganized the Docs directory. Then english language
 	stuff moved to the "C" directory. The french stuff goes under
 	"fr". The "En" and "Fr" directories are gone. The standard for
 	country codes uses lower-cases letters, so we should stick to
 	that. The graphics files go under "pix" directories under their
 	respective language directories.

	* src/scm/path.scm: create documentation search paths based on the
 	current locale. The default "C" locale is always searched last.

	* src/reports/File.c (gncFindFile): take out dead code.

2000-03-04  Heath Martin  <martinh@pegasus.cc.ucf.edu>

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-style.c (set_dimensions_pass_one):
 	Only set the dimensions based on percentages if the dimensions
 	have not been set before.  This gets rid of some strange behavior
 	where styles change width by a few pixels when window size was
 	changed.
	(gnucash_sheet_style_set_dimensions): Add a width argument; now we
 	compute dimensions to fit "width" as best as possible.  Most of
 	the time width should be the allocation width of the sheet, except
 	that when the style is first compiled, the allocation width may be
 	unavailable.
	(style_recompute_layout_dimensions): Set dimensions->width
 	properly.
	(gnucash_style_default_width): Nuke this function, since we can
 	now use dimensions->width.
	(gnucash_sheet_style_compile): Use a default width to set
 	dimensions.

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-sheet.c (gnucash_sheet_set_top_row):
 	Update the canvas before the scroll.  This helps eliminate some of
 	the flashing when the register scrolls.  Still not perfect,
 	though.

2000-03-03  Heath Martin  <martinh@pegasus.cc.ucf.edu>

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-sheet.c
 	(gnucash_sheet_size_allocate): Keep track of the allocation and
 	update everything only if the allocation changes.  This is needed
 	because gnome canvas widget items always do a gtk_widget_set_usize
 	(), which in turn forces a reconfigure of the parent widgets.  So
 	we were getting size_allocate events even when the size of the
 	window was not changing.
	(gnucash_sheet_set_top_row): Scroll the sheet by setting the
 	adjustment values rather than calling gnome_canvas_scroll_to ().

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-header.c
 	(gnucash_header_reconfigure): Set the sheet width from the header.

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-sheet.c
 	(gnucash_sheet_block_set_from_table): Check to see if the style
 	has changed before we reallocate all the entries and colors.
	(gnucash_sheet_block_set_entries): Don't strdup the entries from
 	the table.
	(gnucash_sheet_block_clear_entries): Don't free the text in the
 	entries, since now the table owns this.
	(gnucash_sheet_set_scroll_region): New function; sets the scroll
 	region on the register canvas.
	(gnucash_sheet_update_adjustments): This was being done
 	incorrectly.  The layout widget on which the gnome canvas is based
 	takes care of the adjustments, and we've just connected to these
 	adjustments in the smooth-scroll case.  Now that the scroll region
 	is set correctly, just let the layout manage the adjustments.
	

2000-03-03  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/register/pricecell.c (PriceMV): accept thousands separators.

	* src/scm/c-interface.scm: new functionality for registering
 	translatable strings and saving them to a file in a suitable
 	format for po creation. This touched a bunch of other .scm
	files as well.

2000-03-02  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/gnome/dialog-options.c: use gettext to translate the strings
	used to make the gui components.

	* src/gnome/window-reconcile.c
 	(gnc_reconcile_window_create_list_frame): always show vertical
 	scrollbars, the columns widths work out better that way.

	* src/gnome/reconcile-list.c
 	(gnc_reconcile_list_get_needed_height): better estimate of needed
 	height than just multiplying row height times rows.

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-item-list.c (gnc_item_list_autosize):
 	new function to autosize the list. For some reason, have the list
 	autosize for each new insertion wasn't working for very large
 	registers.

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-sheet.c (gnucash_sheet_new): bump up
 	the scroll region for very large registers.

	* src/gnome/window-main.c (gnc_main_create_toolbar): removed the
 	C-a and C-d shortcuts for adding and deleting accounts.

	* src/gnome/reconcile-list.c (gnc_reconcile_list_init): print
 	selected 'y' reconcile flags in yellow for better contrast.
	(gnc_reconcile_list_unselect_row): don't unselect the row if we
 	are toggling the current row.

	* src/gnome/window-reconcile.c (recnRecalculateBalance): reverse the
	balance if appropriate.

2000-03-01  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

 	balance if appropriate.

	* src/scm/extensions.scm: add the extensions menu if  debugging.

	* src/FileDialog.c (gncFileQIFImport): set the busy cursor when
	reading and processing the qif.

	* src/SplitLedger.c: added a sign-reversal callback.

	* src/gnome/dialog-utils.c (gnc_ui_get_account_full_balance): used
 	the sign-reversal option in computation.

	* src/gnome/top-level.c: implement the sign-reversal configuration
	and callbacks.

	* src/gnome/window-main.c (gnc_ui_refresh_statusbar): used
 	sign-reversal option in computation.

	* src/scm/prefs.scm: add an option to choose how accounts
	are sign-reversed.

2000-02-29  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/gnome/cursors.c (gnc_ui_set_cursor): let the gtk main loop
 	catch up before we exit. This makes sure the cursor gets changed
	before we return.

	* src/gnome/dialog-filebox.c: hide the window before exiting
	the gtk main loop.

	* src/scm/prefs.scm: added a new option for expanding parent
	accounts with double-clicks instead of opening them.

	* src/gnome/window-main.c (gnc_account_tree_activate_cb): use
 	expansion option to decide whether to open or expand.

	* src/SplitLedger.c: check for common currency when saving a
 	register entry. If there is none, don't perform the split
 	insertion; instead show a warning dialog.

	* src/scm/prefs.scm: converted account type and account field
 	options to list options.

	* src/register/gnome/combocell-gnome.c (leaveCombo): if a new
 	value is returned, also set the same value as the cell value.

	* Makefile.in: added 'unfinished' to qt compile target info.

2000-02-28  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/scm/options.scm: added a list option

	* src/scm/report/hello-world.scm: added a demo list option

	* src/gnome/dialog-options.c: added implementation of list options.

	* src/engine/QIFIO.c (xaccParseQIFDate): fix for 4-digit dates.
	(xaccParseQIFDate): fix for x/x' 00 dates, which are an old
	format for 2000 dates.

	* src/scm/report/average-balance.scm: fix report to work when
 	there are no accounts.

	* src/scm/report/transaction-report.scm: initialize the inflow and
 	outflow variables to zero each time the report is run.

2000-02-27  Heath Martin  <martinh@pegasus.cc.ucf.edu>

 	ignore string functions.

	* src/register/table-allgui.c (gnc_table_enter_update): don't set

2000-02-20  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/guile/gfec.c (gfec_catcher): use a guile function for
 	printing the error instead of the C interfaces. This removes
	a dependency on guile 1.3.4.

	* src/scm/c-interface.scm: add function for return an error string.
	Used by the C-side error catcher in gfec.c.

2000-02-13  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/register/splitreg.c (configLayout): swap the xfer and desc
	cells. Add the debit and credit cells to the transaction cursor
	so we get totals.

	* src/register/quickfillcell.h: add a GUI-specific initializer.
	The motif version does nothing. The gnome version add a direct
	callback to handle auto-completion keystrokes.

 	function for passing direct gui input to the table, and then the
 	cells.

2000-02-12  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/gnome/window-register.c: add new account menu item

	* src/engine/Transaction.c (xaccTransCommitEdit): always check the
	split ordering on a commit. Only checking the transaction date won't
	work, because other fields in the transaction and the split affect
	the order.

	* src/engine/Account.c (xaccCheckDateOrder): use
 	xaccSplitDateOrder, the same routine as xaccAccountInsertSplit to
 	do the ordering.

	* src/register/table-allgui.c (gnc_table_modify_update): new
 	function, a direct gui callback.

  	added functions for refreshing all trees and deleting an account
 	from all trees.

	* src/register/basiccell.h: (and lots more files) added a cell
 	callback for getting the 'help' string of a cell. This uses a
	default which uses the value of the cell, if its not blank, and
	a "blank help" otherwise. The blank help string can be set on a
	per-cell basis.

	The date cell replaces the help callback with one that prints the
	date out in full, according to the current locale.

	The split register initialization sets a few of the cells with
	blank help values.

	Finally, the gnome register uses the help strings to set the
	status of the statusbar.

2000-02-10  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/engine/util.c (loglevel): print warnings and errors in

 	toolbar items that need a selected account.

	* src/gnome/dialog-edit.c (editAccWindow): allow dialog to be
 	resized

	* src/scm/extensions.scm: add code for a more flexible menu
 	definition process under guile. Comment out extensions menu
	stuff -- it's not complete.

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-sheet.c (gnucash_button_press_event):
 	after moving, get the cursor position again before setting the
 	item editor cursor position because the cursor position may have
 	changed due to auto-mode rearrangement.

	* src/scm/prefs.scm:comment out locale-based date parsing

	* src/gnome/window-main.c (gnc_main_create_menus): modify the

 	zeros. Add function for changing blank_zero option.

	* src/engine/util.c (PrintAmt): change the trailing zeros argument
	to an integer indicating the minimum number of trailing zeros to
	print.

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-item-list.c: handle mouse wheel
 	scrolling from the clist.

2000-02-07  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/gnome/window-main.c (gnc_ui_refresh_statusbar): set the
 	color of deficit values to red in the main window status bar.

	* src/gnome/account-tree.c (gnc_account_tree_insert_row): only set
 	values as red if they are less than but not extremely close to
 	zero.

	* src/gnome/window-main.c (mainWindow): separate profit and asset
	labels in the status bar.

2000-02-07  Robert Graham Merkel  <rgmerk@mira.net>

 	focus, reformat the value with separators.

	* src/gnome/dialog-transfer.c: parse amount with xaccParseAmount.
	When the amount entry goes out of focus, reformat the value with
	separators.

	* src/gnome/reconcile-list.c (gnc_reconcile_list_fill): print the
 	amount with xaccPrintAmount, with separators.

	* src/gnome/window-reconcile.c (startRecnWindow): print the amount

	and trailing zeros option. removed the 'shares' option.

	* src/engine/util.c (xaccSPrintAmountGeneral): add a generalized
 	amount printing function.

	* src/gnome/window-register.c (gnc_register_date_window): add a
 	button to the date range window for setting the date range when
 	the user changes a date without 'enter' or 'double-click'.

	* src/engine/Account.c (xaccAccountGetFullName): moved this function
	from gnome to here to make it gui independent. Returns a malloc'd
	string with the fully-qualified name of the account using the given
	separator char.

2000-02-06  Heath Martin  <martinh@pegasus.cc.ucf.edu>

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-header.c
 	(gnucash_header_auto_resize_column): Support for auto sizing.

 	the big rectangle correctly.
	(gnucash_header_reconfigure): Set the scroll region and header

	* src/register/pricecell.c: get rid of the format string, add an
 	option for printing share quantities.

	* src/engine/Session.c (MakeHomeDir): just because ~/.gnucash
 	exists doens't mean ~/.gnucash/data exists.

	* src/scm/report/hello-world.scm: renamed from dummy.scm. Added
	documentation to the source code and additional help text in the
	report. This is intended to be an example for how to write reports.

	* src/gnome/window-report.c (reportAnchorCB): use gnome_url_show
	to display the anchors.

	* src/gnome/window-help.c (helpAnchorCB): use gnome_url_show to
	display the other anchor types.

	* src/gnome/dialog-utils.c: removed tooltip setting function. I was
	using tooltips the wrong way. Instead of having one tooltips object
	for each tip, you use one tooltips object for each logical group of
	tips, i.e., all the tips on a dialog. Also, changed the dialogs to
	use this method.

	* src/gnome/dialog-transfer.c: use labels with colons.

2000-02-04  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

 	input.

2000-02-03  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/register/gnome/combocell-gnome.c (enterCombo): sort the list
 	before popping up.

	* src/engine/Query.c: do num sorting using numerical values where
 	possible.

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-item-edit.c: added new functions for
	cutting, copying, and pasting the clipboard. We have to do this
	manually instead of relying in the gtk_entry, as it screws up the
	selection handling.

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-sheet.c (gnucash_sheet_insert_cb):
 	fixed bug where new text was being copied incorrectly for
 	insertions longer than a character.

2000-01-30  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/scm/bootstrap.scm.in: deleted hash-for-each. This is defined
	in slib2c6, which we are requiring anyway. Not the thunk for this
	should accept two args: the key and the value.

	* src/register/QuickFill.c: add sorting option to choose between
	LIFO and alphabetic orders.

2000-01-29  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/scm/bootstrap.scm.in: Used Matt Martin's guile error catching
	code to print errors from gnc:load.

	* src/scm/report/transaction-report.scm: change to handle new
 	reports.

	* src/scm/report/dummy.scm: change to handle new reports.

 	which generates a new set of options. Change the report running
 	functions to accomodate this.

	* src/FileDialog.c: avoid showing multiple error dialogs.

	* src/guile/gfec.c (gfec_catcher): new file with functions for
 	running scheme code with error handlers. Grabbed this off the
 	guile faq and made a few mods.

	* src/gnome/window-report.c: modify to use the new gfec routines.

2000-01-27  Robert Graham Merkel  <rgmerk@mira.net>

	return a corresponding sorting predicate
	"Account Transactions" report: added sorting.

2000-01-25  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/gnome/window-register.c (regRefresh): refresh the window name

	* src/gnome/dialog-edit.c: Rob Merkel's patch to reparent accounts.

	* src/engine/Account.c (xaccAccountHasAncestor): new function to
	determine whether an account has another as an ancestor.

	* src/gnome/account-tree.c (gnc_account_tree_set_filter): add a
 	filter function to an account tree to select a subset of accounts.

	* src/engine/Query.c: some new functions for setting the date
 	ranges.

	* src/gnome/window-register.c: add 'show earliest' and 'show
 	latest' options to the date range window.

2000-01-25  Heath Martin  <martinh@pegasus.cc.ucf.edu>

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-grid.c (gnucash_grid_init):
 	Initialize the fonts here.

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-style.c
 	(gnucash_sheet_style_compile): Use sheet->grid->normal_font for
 	all the computations.  style->fonts[][] is now only used for
 	drawing in gnucash-grid, etc. when it's non-NULL.

2000-01-24  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/register/splitreg.c (xaccInitSplitRegister): make the action
	cell accept strings not in the list.

	* src/register/gnome/combocell-gnome.c (xaccComboCellSetStrict):
	new function that determines whether the combo accepts strings
	not in the list. Defaults to 'does not accept'.


2000-01-23  Heath Martin  <martinh@pegasus.cc.ucf.edu>

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-style.c: Many functions touched.
  	Fairly extensive changes to how the layouts and dimensions are
 	handled.  We now lump together cursors which should have same
 	dimensions (e.g. all the single line cursors have the same layout
 	and dimension data).

2000-01-21  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-sheet.c
 	(gnucash_sheet_key_press_event): oh, what a hack! The extra stuff
 	is to make sure the selection is changed appropriately according
 	to the key that is pressed. Some of the logic is extracted from
 	gtkentry.c so the behavior is similar. We have to do this because
 	the entry widget is not realized and thus does not change its
 	selection as usual. However, we can't realize it, see the
 	explanation below.

	* src/register/gnome/combocell-gnome.c: added quickfilling

	selection args.

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-sheet.c (gnucash_sheet_new): ok,
 	*don't* put the entry in a widget. We can't have it realized
 	because it screws up the selection changes during the insert/
 	delete callbacks. We're going to have to fake the other
 	functionality.

	* src/register/QuickFill.c: make quickfill work on non-alphabet
	characters.

	the signals after the value has been set so the dialog isn't already
	in a changed state.

2000-01-17  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/register/table-allgui.c (gnc_table_traverse_update): Use the
	exit flags from the cellblock to decide how to set
	exit_register, and don't change entries in the traverse arrays
	to positive.

	and columns, too.

	* src/register/cellblock.h: Add variables to the CellBlock struct

	* src/register/pricecell.c (xaccPriceCellPrintValue): new
 	function.  return a pointer to a static string buffer with the

 	(at least for gnome) and complicate the leave semantics.

	* src/SplitLedger.c (xaccSRGetCurrentTrans): use the register
 	physical row and not the table. needed for auto mode movement.

	* src/register/table-allgui.c (gnc_table_leave_update): do the
 	wrapverify after we check for changes. I'm not sure if wrapverify
 	could change the outcome of this, but doing the check after the
 	wrap verify makes no sense since the row and col values aren't
 	meaningful anymore.

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-sheet.c
 	(gnucash_sheet_deactivate_cursor_cell): always call the leave
 	update, even for "bad" locations. We need the wrap verify that

 	callback to update the default currency when options are changed
	(default_configure_newacc_currency) does the work of updating
	(gnucash_ui_init) registered the new callback

	* src/register/table-allgui.c (gnc_table_traverse_update): a fix
 	for the auto modes.

	* src/SplitLedger.c (xaccSRCountRows): Look for the cursor
 	position using the transaction, as well as the split. Useful when
 	changing modes when you are on a blank split in multi-line.
	(xaccSRGetCurrentTrans): new function. Gets current transaction.
  	Works when you are on blank splits as well.
	(LedgerTraverse): save the old register values and then restore
 	them.

 	(gnucash_header_reconfigure): check for a valid header row before
 	proceeding.

1999-12-13  Heath Martin  <martinh@pegasus.cc.ucf.edu>

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-cursor.c (gnucash_cursor_set): Set
 	the type and row arguments in the header.

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-header.c (gnucash_header_draw): Tweak
 	the coords on the separator line a bit.  Draw the header based on
 	header->type and header->row.
	(gnucash_header_set_arg): Add two new arguments to support setting
 	the type of the header from the current cursor and the row within
 	the cursor to draw.

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-style.c
 	(gnucash_sheet_style_compile): Set the header font.

1999-12-13  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/gnome/option-util.c (gnc_lookup_multichoice_option): Rob
 	Merkel's patch.

	* src/engine/date.c (printDate): Rob Merkel's patch to i18n date
 	formats.

	* src/gnome/top-level.c (gnc_configure_date_format): Rob Merkel's
	patch to i18n date formats.

1999-12-12  Heath Martin  <martinh@pegasus.cc.ucf.edu>

	* src/register/table-allgui.c (gnc_table_traverse_update): Put an
 	assert(0) in the default case, since now we handle all possible
 	cases.

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-sheet.c
 	(gnucash_sheet_key_press_event): Remove hack to wrap around when
 	moving the cursor.  splitreg.c takes care of this, after a
 	fashion.

1999-12-12  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/register/gnome/combocell-gnome.c (disconnect_list_signals):
 	if the list has been destroyed, don't bother.
	(connect_list_signals): ditto.

1999-12-10  Heath Martin  <martinh@pegasus.cc.ucf.edu>

	* src/register/splitreg.c (configTraverse): Configure left
 	traverses, too.

	* src/register/cellblock.[c,h] (xaccInitCellBlock): Allocate left
 	traverse matrices.
 	(FreeCellBlockMem): Free left traverse matrices.
 	(xaccNextLeft): New function.

	* src/register/table-allgui.c (gnc_table_traverse_update): Add
 	support for left traverses.

1999-12-10  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/gnome/window-register.c (jump_cb): new callback. Used to
 	jump to 'other' account.

	* src/gnome/option-util.c: modify multichoice
 	functions. multichoice options are now a list of vectors,
	where each vector contains the value, name, and description.

	* src/gnome/dialog-options.c (gnc_option_set_ui_widget): Rob
 	Merkel's patch to add the option name to a multichoice option.

1999-12-09  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/gnome/dialog-utils.c (gnc_build_option_menu): change this
 	function so that the callback includes the index of the selection
 	as well as the user_data.

	* src/gnome/option-util.c
 	(gnc_option_value_num_permissible_values): new function. return #
 	of permissible values.
	(gnc_option_value_permissible_value_index): new function. search
 	for SCM value in permissible value list.
	(gnc_option_value_permissible_value_name): new function. return
 	name of indexth permissible value.
	(gnc_option_value_permissible_value_help): new function. return
 	help of indexth permissible value.

	* src/gnome/dialog-options.c (gnc_option_set_ui_value): add
 	multichoice option.
	(gnc_option_get_ui_value): add multichoice option.
	(gnc_option_multichoice_cb): new function. callback for
 	multichoice buttons. We use an object data with key
 	"gnc_multichoice_index" to store the index with the option menu.
	(gnc_option_create_multichoice_widget): new function. create the
 	widget for multichoice options.
	(gnc_option_set_ui_widget): add multichoice option.

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-sheet.c
 	(gnucash_sheet_block_destroy): Don't free the entries and colors,
 	that is done by gnucash_sheet_block_clear_entries now.
	(gnucash_sheet_block_clear_entries): Set the freed pointers to
 	NULL for safety.

1999-12-09  Heath Martin  <martinh@pegasus.cc.ucf.edu>

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-color.c (color_hash): The argument is
 	an argb, not a GdkColor. So we'll just use its value directly.
  	This fixes a bug in that we were getting lots of failed color
 	lookups in the hash table, and therefore lots of redundant
 	insertions.

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-sheet.c
 	(gnucash_sheet_block_clear_entries): Free entries, fg_colors,
 	bg_colors here. We were leaking [fg,bg]_colors.


1999-12-09  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/gnome/window-register.c (regWindowLedger): set the window
	policy to allow shrinking and growing.

	* src/SplitLedger.c (xaccSRSaveRegEntry): change the memo
	before you create the 'other' split, so it gets the same memo.
	Also, if we are committing the blank split, insert it into the
	account before we create the 'other' split, so the other split
	can get a parent account, too.

1999-12-08  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/scm/main.scm (gnc:ui-finish): destroy the ui subwindows
	before doing a file-query-save. The register windows need to
	be closed before saving, in case there are edited transactions.

	* src/gnome/top-level.c (gnc_ui_destroy_all_subwindows): new
 	function.  used by guile to destroy all non-main windows.

	* src/gnome/window-help.c (gnc_ui_destroy_html_windows): new
 	function.  destroy any help or report windows open.

1999-12-08  Heath Martin  <martinh@pegasus.cc.ucf.edu>

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-cursor.c (gnucash_item_cursor_draw):
 	Draw an inner rectangle in the cell cursor.  This balances the
 	cursor top/bottom versus sides, and fixes some ugliness especially
 	in double line mode.

1999-12-08  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/SplitLedger.c (xaccSRLoadRegister): restore original
 	position a bit more accurately.

1999-12-07  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/scm/text-export.scm (gnc:account-transactions-export-as-text):
	return #f as value so the traversal keeps going. (See Group.h).

	* src/g-wrap/gnc-helpers.c: use gh_long2scm instead of the
	long long version. This is incorrect for very large values,
	but longlong doesn't seem to be working right now.

	* src/engine/LedgerUtils.c (accListHasAccount): new function.
	search for account in list.

	* src/MultiLedger.c: Only add the leader if it wasn't in the list.

	* src/gnome/window-register.c (gnc_register_create_menu_bar):
	Added an option to scrub the account. Changed Register menu
	to Account menu.

	* src/engine/Transaction.c (MARK_SPLIT): mark the account group
	as not saved. Ensures we get a "do you want to save" dialog.

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-sheet.c (compute_optimal_height):
	request height for DEFAULT_REGISTER_ROWS rows.

	* src/gnome/window-register.c (deleteCB): fancy deletes.

1999-12-06  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/SplitLedger.c (xaccSRSaveRegEntry): Insert the blank split
 	into the account when it is committed, not when it is created.
  	Otherwise, the blank split gets saved to a file if you save with
 	an open register. Also, it gets stuck in the reconcile window if
 	you open that with an open register.

	* src/register/pricecell.c (xaccSetDebCredCellValue): simplify
	and fix value setting bug.

	* src/SplitLedger.c (xaccSRCancelCursorTransChanges): new
 	function. Cancel the changes to the current transaction.

	* src/motif/RegWindow.c (cancelCB): use SR functions instead.

	* src/g-wrap/gnc.gwp: add wrapper for xaccGroupGetBalance

	* src/gnome/window-register.c (regWindowLedger): take out the size
 	code altogether.

1999-12-06  Heath Martin  <martinh@pegasus.cc.ucf.edu>

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-sheet.c (DEFAULT_REGISTER_WIDTH):
 	Increase this a little, so at least a checking account register is
 	drawn correctly.  This is a hack for now anyway until the
 	computations in gnucash-style.c are reworked.

	* src/gnome/window-register.c (regWindowLedger): Comment out the
 	call to gtk_widget_set_usize (), so the register window finds it's
 	own natural size.

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-header.c
 	(gnucash_header_reconfigure): Compute w, h correctly.

1999-12-05  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/gnome/window-register.c (closeCB): Query the user as to
 	whether or not to save a changed transaction.

	* src/MultiLedger.c (xaccLedgerDisplayClose): Only refresh
	if there were really changes.

	* src/SplitLedger.c (LedgerDestroy): Paranoia checks.

	* src/gnome/window-register.c (regWindowLedger): catch the register
	"activate_cursor" signal. Upon receipt, record the transaction and
	move to the next virtual row.

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-sheet.c
 	(gnucash_register_goto_next_virt_row): new function. Cause the
	register cursor to advance to the next virtual row.

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-sheet.h: Add a "activate_cursor"
 	callback to the register that is emitted when the user pressed
 	return.

1999-12-04  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/gnome/window-main.c (gnc_ui_mainWindow_scrub): new function.
  	Scrub the current account.
	(gnc_ui_mainWindow_toolbar_open_subs): new function.
	Open subaccounts.

	Cause the given register window to be raised to the top.

	* src/gnome/scripts_menu.c (gnc_extensions_menu_add_item): We have
 	to register the scheme scripts to make sure they aren't
 	garbage-collected.
	(gnc_extensions_shutdown): New function. Call when shutting down
	to free memory structures and unregister scheme scripts.

	* src/gnome/window-register.c (gnc_register_create_popup_menu): new
	function. Create a popup menu for the register.
	(regWindowLedger): Add the popup menu to the register.

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-sheet.c (gnucash_button_press_event):
	return FALSE for unused events so they are passed up the hierarchy.

	* src/gnome/window-adjust.c (adjBWindow): use fully qualified
	account name in window title.

	* src/gnome/window-register.c (regWindowLedger): use fully
 	qualified name in the title of the window.

	* src/gnome/dialog-utils.c (gnc_ui_get_account_full_name): new
 	function. Construct the fully-qualified account name using the
	given separator string.

	* src/engine/Account.c (xaccAccountGetParentAccount): new function.
	Return the parent account of an account.

	* src/engine/Group.c (xaccGroupGetParentAccount): new function.
	Return the parent account of a group.

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-sheet.c (gnucash_sheet_key_press_event):
	respond to keypad directional keys.

1999-12-03  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/SplitLedger.c (xaccSRLoadRegister): When we refresh, look
 	for the pending transaction. If we don't find it, clear the
 	pending transaction to prevent it being committed later.

	* src/g-wrap/gnc.gwp: added binding for reportWindowDirect

	* src/gnome/window-register.c (helpCB): help window should not
	be parented.

	* src/gnome/window-main.c (gnc_ui_help_cb): help window should
	not be parented.
	(gnc_ui_reports_cb): reports window should not be parented.

	* src/engine/Transaction.c (xaccTransBeginEdit): Check for an
 	already open transaction.
	(xaccTransIsOpen): new function. returns true if transaction
	is open for editing.

	* src/gnome/window-register.c (regWindowLedger): Use a gnome dock
 	to hold the window contents. This is more flexible.
	(gnc_register_create_tool_bar): use graphical buttons. Also, don't
 	create the handle box, the gnome dock item will handle that.
	(gnc_register_create_menu_bar): don't create the handle box.

	* src/reports/Sheet.c: Rob Merkel's patch for locating eperl

	* src/gnome/account-tree.c (gnc_account_tree_refresh): tighter
 	bounds on adjustment value. Prevents quirks when refreshing to
	a smaller number of accounts.

	* configure.in: Rob Merkel's eperl and gtkxmhtml build patches

	* Makefile.in: Rob Merkel's patch to enforce gtkxmhtml requirement

	* src/gnome/window-register.c (deleteCB): use
 	xaccSRDeleteCurrentSplit to delete the split.

1999-12-02  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/register/gnome/combocell-gnome.c (moveCombo): disconnect
	the list signals.

	* src/SplitLedger.c (LedgerMoveCursor): update cursor_phys_row and
 	cursor_virt_row in the SplitRegiter.
	(xaccSRDeleteCurrentSplit): new function. delete the current split
 	in the register.
	(xaccSRCountRows): don't move the saved physical and virtual rows
	if the current split was NULL.

	* Makefile.in: Added Tyson Dowd's rules to rerun autoconf
	and configure when needed.

1999-12-01  Rob Browning  <rlb@cs.utexas.edu>

	* src/scm/txn-create.scm: remove trailing garbage.

	* src/scm/srfi: new directory containing source for various Scheme
	Requests for Implementation.  We now have srfi-8 and srfi-1.
	These are very useful.  Docs are available at
	http://srfi.schemers.org/.

	* src/scm/report/folio.scm: new file implementing
	Reports/report-folio.phtml.  Not finished, but not loaded either.

	* src/scm/report/dummy.scm: new file to test the report system.
	Shows the current date.

	* src/scm/report/balance-and-pnl.scm: new file to generate balance
	sheet and profit and loss reports.  Implements
	Reports/report-baln.phtml and Reports/report-pnl.phtml.  The code
	in here could be better, but it's not awful.  It's mostly a
	straight eperl port.

	* src/scm/report.scm: new file implementing the initial
	scheme-based report system.

	* src/scm/main.scm: use the new depend mechanism and load the new
	srfis

	* src/scm/extensions.scm: reformat so all the code doesn't go off
	the right side of a normal screen (with tabs set to 8, etc).
	Linas might veto this, but I thought it was worthwhile.

	* src/scm/depend.scm: new file adding a support/depend mechanism.
	Modify other files to start using it.

1999-11-30  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/gnome/window-help.c: extensive rewrite. Revamped look to use
	dockable toolbar. Handle motion keys. Escape key closes window.
	Graphics are now loaded.

1999-11-28  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/register/table-allgui.c (doMoveCursor): don't scroll when we
	update the cursor after the the callback.

	* src/register/table-gnome.c (doRefreshCursorGUI): same as below

	* src/register/table-motif.c (doRefreshCursorGUI): same as below

	* src/register/table-allgui.c (xaccRefreshCursorGUI): add a
 	do_scroll argument to determine whether the gui should scroll to
 	make the cursor visible. This lets us cut down on flashing.

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-sheet.c (gnucash_sheet_table_load):
 	try to avoid scrolling
	(gnucash_sheet_cursor_set_from_table): remove redundant call to
 	update adjustments.

	* src/gnome/window-register.c (cancelCB): use
 	xaccSplitRegisterClearChangeFlag.
	(gnc_register_create_tool_bar): right-align the displayed balances

	* src/register/splitreg.c (xaccSplitRegisterClearChangeFlag): new
 	function. Clear the change flags of the register.

	* src/SplitLedger.c (xaccSRCancelCursorChanges): new
 	function. Cancel the changes made to the current cursor.

1999-11-27  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/gnome/window-register.c (regWindowLedger): set default sort
	order to the standard order.
	(gnc_build_ledger_sort_order_menu): add the standard order to the
	list of options.
	(gnc_ledger_sort_cb): handle the standard order

	* src/engine/Query.c (xaccQuerySetSortOrder): added BY_STANDARD and
 	BY_NONE sort orders.

	* src/register/splitreg.c (configLayout): configure the single
 	cursor last so the header is the most reasonable. This is a
 	hack. Eventually, we should probably switch headers dyamically.

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-sheet.c
 	(gnucash_register_goto_virt_row_col): replaces and generalizes
 	gnucash_sheet_go_to_last_row.

	* src/gnome/window-register.c (gnc_register_jump_to_blank): new
 	function to jump to the blank split.
	(new_trans_cb): use gnc_register_jump_to_blank
	(regWindowLedger): jump to the blank split with above function
 	before returning

	* src/SplitLedger.c (xaccSRGetSplitRowCol): new function
	(xaccSRGetBlankSplit): new function

	* src/register/splitreg.c (configLabels): apply Rob Walker's patch
	to fix the labels.

	* src/gnome/window-register.c (gnc_register_date_cb): set start
 	date to the first second of the day selected and the end date to
 	the last second of the day selected.

	* src/engine/Query.c (xaccQueryGetSplits): fixed a problem to
 	prevent returning one split too many. We need to check for the
	max date before we add the split.

1999-11-23  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-sheet.c (gnucash_sheet_go_to_last_row): 
	jump to the last row in the sheet. This will be the blank split.

	* src/gnome/window-register.c (gnc_register_create_menu_bar): add
	a menu item for moving to the blank split
	(regWindowLedger): jump to the last row, i.e., the blank split,
	before you return.

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-style.c (gnucash_style_layout_init):
 	make the reconcile cell visible in mult-line mode. It's not
 	active, but it looks better.

	* src/SplitLedger.c (LedgerMoveCursor): tell xaccSRSaveRegEntry
 	which transaction we are moving to.
	(xaccSRSaveRegEntry): add an argument to indicate which
 	transaction will be current after the save. This allows us to
 	commit right away if we are changing transactions and keeps the
 	register gui in sync with the engine.

	* src/register/table-allgui.c (doMoveCursor): refresh the gui
 	cursor after the second makePassive if we are moving the gui.
  	This fixes a refresh bug that happens if the splits get reordered.

	* configure.in and src/gnome/Makefile.in: Rob Merkel's patch
	to check for gtkxmhtml
	
	* src/scm: applied Rob Walker's patch to add a version argument
	
	* src/gnome/account-tree.c (gnc_account_tree_init): auto resize
	the first column

	* src/gnome/window-main.c (mainWindow): give focus to the
	account tree before we exit

1999-11-22  Rob Browning  <rlb@cs.utexas.edu>

	* src/register/table-motif.c (modifyCB): *trivial* modification to
	support modify_verify cursor_position arg.  I'm not in a position
	to easily deal with the XmBae callback complexity.  This should
	just leave the status-quo.

	* src/motif/RegWindow.c (dateChangeCB): ditto.

	* src/register/table-allgui.[hc]: quickfill fixes, support the new
	modify_verify cursor_position arg.

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-sheet.c: quickfill fixes, use the new
	modify_verify cursor_position arg.

	* ChangeLog: merge all the src/register/gnome/ChangeLog entries
	into this file and delete that file to finish up what Dave started
	on 1999-11-20.  Aside from being cleaner, it also makes emacs (and
	I suspect other editors) automatically find the right file when
	you do a "C-x 4 a" (changelog-add-entry).

	* src/register/*cell.h: added position (int *) parameter to
	all cell MV calls.  This allows the callback to reposition the
	cursor within the text if needed.  This was required by the
	quickfill fix, but is probably useful elsewhere.

	* src/register/quickfillcell.c (quick_modify): fixed so that
	cursor tracks as you type along with some other important bugs
	(quickfill divergences now cause the remainder of the stale fill
	to be deleted, etc.)

1999-11-21  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/gnome/window-register.c: (recordCB): when when record
	a new or existing transaction, make sure it will be in the
	date range we are viewing.

	* src/register/table-allgui.c: (gnc_table_traverse_update): handle
 	pointer traversals a bit more intelligently.

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-item-edit.c: (item_edit_set_cursor_pos)
	fix for when you enter a cell that's right-aligned.
	
1999-11-20  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

        * src/register/gnome/ChangeLog: we're going to stop using this
	changlog file and put all changes in the top-level ChangLog file.

	* src/gnome/reconcile-list.[ch]: Use a hash table to remember
	reconcile flags after a refresh. Also remember scroll position.
	Change row styles so active row isn't highlited.

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-sheet.c:
 	(gnucash_button_press_event): For now, we need to enter the cell,
 	even if we're already there. The reconcile cell, for instance,
 	depends on this behavior. But, if we're entering the cell where we
 	already are, we remember the cursor position and try to go back to
 	it. Also, when we're entering a new cell it's drawn as if we're at
 	cursor position 0, so tell item_edit_set_cursor.

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-item-edit.c (item_edit_draw_info):
 	new function to calculate drawing parameters for the item
 	editor. This is used both in drawing and in calculating the place
 	to move the cursor to for mouse traversals.
	(item_edit_draw): use item_edit_draw_info
	(item_edit_set_cursor_pos): use item_edit_draw_info

1999-11-19  Heath Martin  <martinh@pegasus.cc.ucf.edu>

	* gnucash-cursor.c (gnucash_item_cursor_draw): Use light gray for
 	the cell cursor; experimental to see if we like it.
	(gnucash_item_cursor_draw): Draw the inside rectangle slightly
 	inside.
	(gnucash_cursor_request_redraw): Tighten up the bounds now that we
 	don't have the outside rectangle.

	* gnucash-sheet.c (gnucash_button_press_event): Only move the cursor
	if the button press moves us to a new cell.  Set the editing cursor.

	* gnucash-item-edit.c (item_edit_draw): Take justification into
 	account here.  Use CELL_HPADDING, CELL_VPADDING instead of magic
 	constants to set the clip rectangle and the offsets.
	(item_edit_set_cursor_pos): New function.
	(item_edit_update): Adjust the positioning of the list now that we
 	don't have the outer rectangle.

1999-11-19  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/gnome/account-tree.c: remember expansion state and
	scroll position after a refresh.

	* src/gnome/query-user.[ch]: add parented versions of the
	query dialogs.

	* src/gnome/: modify dialogs to use parented dialogs

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-cursor.c: (gnucash_item_cursor_draw):
	Heath's mod which removes the outer rectangle.

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-item-edit.c: (item_edit_update):
	Heath's mod to make the combo list draw correctly

1999-11-18  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/engine/util.c: (PrtAmtComma): fixed
	rounding error when remainder is close to 1.

1999-11-17  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-header.[ch]: removed type
	variable. The header should always be type GNUCASH_CURSOR_HEADER

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-style.c:
	(gnucash_sheet_style_compile): use the cell labels for the header
	style labels
	
	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-item-edit.[ch]: Added a toggle button
	for popping the combo list.

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-style.c: (gnucash_style_layout_init)
	make the width of the 'num' column of the split cursor the same as
	the others.

1999-11-15  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-sheet.c: (gnucash_sheet_delete_cb)
	and
	(gnucash_sheet_insert_cb): use malloc/free instead of glib
	routines for newval. newval may be free()d by routines in the
	register code. You can't mix-n-match.

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-sheet.c (gnucash_sheet_destroy) and
	(gnucash_sheet_new): sink the entry and unref it after the item
	editor is destroyed. This fixes a memory leak, the entry was not
	being finalized.

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-sheet.c add
	(gnucash_sheet_key_press): allow outside entities to pass
	keystrokes to the sheet. Used by the combocell.

	* src/register/gnome/combocell-gnome-c: extensive modifications to
	support the new list item.

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-item-edit.[ch]: ditto

1999-11-12  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/engine/util.c: (xaccSPrintAmount): print values
	very close to 0 as 0 without negative sign.

	* lib/README: updated to indicate obsolete packages.

	* lib/Makefile.in: don't build g-wrap if g-wrap-install
	directory exists

	* src/guile-util.c: (gnc_register_c_side_scheme_ptr):
	modified to return SCM handle, which is used with
	(gnc_unregister_c_side_scheme_ptr) to unregister.

	* src/gnome/option-util.c: added (gnc_options_init)
	and (gnc_options_shutdown).

	* src/gnome/top-level.c: call above functions at
	appropriate times.

	* src/gnome/account-tree.c: (gnc_account_tree_select_account):
	scroll to make sure account is visible.

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-item-edit.c: (item_edit_draw): make
	the cursor larger and allow it to be seen even when it's at the
	end of a too-long-to-fit-in-cell string.

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-item-list.[ch]: new code to support
	the combo cell.
	
1999-11-10  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/gnome/dialog-filebox.c: Use GtkFileSelection instead
	of GtkFileSelection2.

	* build: Changed configure.in/Makefile.in's to remove dependencies
	on gtkfilel2.

	* build: automatically rebuild gnc.[ch] when gnc.gwp changes *or*
	if you switch from motif to gnome build or vice versa.

	* src/gnome/window-main.: added Save As menu item.

	* src/register/gnome/combocell-gnome.c: reformatted to be
	idiomatic

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-sheet.c:
	(gnucash_sheet_key_press_event): Added support for pageup/down and
	home/end keypressed.

1999-11-07  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/Refresh.c: Added this code for refreshing account-related
 	windows when accounts change. Right now, this is registers and
 	reconcile windows.

	* src/gnome/window-register.c: fixed deleting of blank split
	
	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-sheet.c
	(gnucash_sheet_activate_cursor_cell): handle enter updates when
	new_text is non-null by updating the cell from the table and *not*
	src/register/gnome/starting the editing widget.

	* gnucash-grid.c (draw_cell): used CELL_HPADDING for right justify
	adjustment on x value instead of CELL_VPADDING.

1999-11-05  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-grid.c (gnucash_grid_draw): use
	g_return_if_fail for error checks.

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-grid.c (gnucash_grid_unrealize):
	Sanity checks before unrefing the gc's.

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-header.c (gnucash_header_unrealize):
	sanity checks

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-currsor.c (gnucash_cursor_unrealize):
	sanity checks

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-sheet.h (GnucashRegisterClass):
	parent class should be GtkTableClass

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-sheet.c
	(gnucash_sheet_update_adjustments): update page_increment, so
	clicking on the rest of the scrollbar scrolls one page

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-sheet.c
	(gnucash_sheet_key_press_event): call gnc_table_traverse_update on
	up/down motion.

1999-11-04  Dave Peticolas  <peticola@cs.ucdavis.edu>

	* Add this changelog entry which I should have done a long
	time ago.

	* Rework most of the src/gnome stuff to be compliant with
	gnome-standards.

	* Add QIF fixes.

	* Add Transfer and Adjust Balance windows.

	* Add gnome<->guile options interface.

	* Add c-side SCM registry, courtesy of Rob.

	* Add Alexandru's register window enhancements.

	* Add Heath's gnome register enhancements.

	* Remove dependencies on gtksheet. Hooray!

	* src/register/gnome Various: a few fixes here and there to make
	everything compile cleanly under -Wall. Mainly removing unused
	local variables, and changing g_return_if_fail to
	g_return_val_if_fail for functions which return a value. Added a
	few prototypes that were missing. Cleaned up #includes.

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-sheet.c (gnucash_register_new): Make
	the vertical scrollbar flush with the top of the register.

	* src/register/gnome/Makefile.in: removed motif and qt
	targets. Made gnome target the default.

1999-08-30  Heath Martin  <martinh@pegasus.cc.ucf.edu>

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-sheet.c
	(gnucash_sheet_key_press_event): Be sure to set new_p_row in the
	case GDK_Tab, since the function gnc_table_traverse_update checks
	the proposed new row/col, so we need to initialize properly.

1999-08-28  Heath Martin  <martinh@pegasus.cc.ucf.edu>

	* TODO: New file.

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-style.c (gnucash_style_init): Removed
	the dependency on gnome-print for now.  We may want to use the
	gnome-print library in the future.

	* Makefile.in (LIBS): Ditto

1999-08-25  Rob Browning  <rlb@cs.utexas.edu>

	* Add ./README.gnome-hackers.

	* Add ./README.guile-hackers.

	* Add this file (./ChangeLog).  I'm planning to add change
	information here, and I invite others to do the same.  For those
	that use emacs, 'C-x 4 a' adds a new entry.  If people don't like
	this idea, we can drop it.

	* Add new scheme function gnc:choose-item-from-list-dialog.  There
	is C side code, but it's only meant to be called from scheme.
	This function is quite flexible in handles selections.  Eventually
	we might want to generalize this even more, but there are some GC
	issues to consider.  See src/gnome/query-user.c and gnc.gwp for
	details, and see src/scm/extensions.scm for an example usage.

	* IMPORTANT: queryBox signature has changed.  See the docs in
	src/gnome/query-user.c and in gnc.gwp for details.

	* Remove queryBox stubs from Motif side.  Motif doesn't support it
	(yet), and with gnc.gwp conditional inclusion we can just ignore
	it on the motif side.

	* Add function (current-gnc-compile-flavor) to gnc.gwp so that we
	can have conditional blocks.  Possible return values are 'gnome
	and 'motif.

1999-08-23  Heath Martin  <martinh@pegasus.cc.ucf.edu>

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-header.c (gnucash_header_draw): Added
	a separator line between the header and the register entries.

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-item-edit.c (item_edit_new): Attempt
	to implement the comboboxes.  For some reason, I can't get combos
	to work, something related to how the widget size is computed.
	Comment this out for now.

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-item-edit.c (item_edit_set_arg):
	Ditto

1999-08-20  Heath Martin  <martinh@pegasus.cc.ucf.edu>

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-grid.c (draw_cell): Set the
	background/foreground color on a per cell basis.  This obsoletes
	the bg/fg colors in the styles for now.

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-sheet.c
	(gnucash_sheet_block_clear_entries): Fixed a big memory leak here.
	(gnucash_sheet_block_set_entries): Support for background and
	foreground colors for the cells.  Set these from the table.

1999-08-19  Heath Martin  <martinh@pegasus.cc.ucf.edu>

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-style.c (gnucash_style_layout_init):
	Layout the stock registers.

1999-08-18  Heath Martin  <martinh@pegasus.cc.ucf.edu>

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-grid.c (gnucash_grid_draw): When the
	block is active, if a cell doesn't have a user-entered string,
	then draw the label for that cell type as a hint for what should
	be entered.  TODO: Don't draw the label if the cell isn't an
	input/output cell, or whatever.

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-style.c
	(gnucash_sheet_style_compile): Initialize the labels[][] array in
	the style.

1999-08-17  Heath Martin  <martinh@pegasus.cc.ucf.edu>

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-cursor.c (configure_bounds): Do this
	the right way.

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-item-edit.c (item_edit_draw): Added
	the clip rectangle, and made it so the text scrolls to keep the
	cursor in view.

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-grid.c (gnucash_grid_draw): Added the
	clip rectangle.

1999-08-14  Heath Martin  <martinh@pegasus.cc.ucf.edu>

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-cursor.c
	(gnucash_cursor_get_pixel_coords): Take into account the alignment
	offsets.

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-item-edit.c
	(item_edit_get_pixel_coords): Take into account the alignment
	offsets.

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-grid.c
	(gnucash_grid_find_block_origin_by_pixel): Fixed an off-by-one
	mistake.

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-sheet.c
	(gnucash_sheet_make_cell_visible): New function
	(gnucash_sheet_cursor_move): Make the cell visible.
	(gnucash_sheet_set_top_row): Added support for aligning on the top
	or bottom row.
	(gnucash_sheet_update_adjustments): Fixed this so the sheet can't
	scroll past the bottom row.

1999-08-12  Heath Martin  <martinh@pegasus.cc.ucf.edu>

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-sheet.c
	(gnucash_sheet_activate_cursor_cell): With Alexandru's patches, we
	seem to need to grab the focus.  We'll probably need this
	elsewhere.

1999-08-11  Heath Martin  <martinh@pegasus.cc.ucf.edu>

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-sheet.c (gnucash_button_press_event):
	New function.

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-grid.c
	(gnucash_grid_find_block_origin_by_pixel): Add a return value.
	(gnucash_grid_find_cell_origin_by_pixel): New function.

	dimensions.
	(gnucash_sheet_size_allocate): Recompute style dimensions.

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-item-edit.c
	(item_edit_get_pixel_coords): We need to compute pixels relative
	to the canvas origin, not the window origin.  Duh.  (Note that
	canvas sends coordinates to a draw function relative to the canvas
	origin.)

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-cursor.c
	(gnucash_cursor_get_pixel_coords): Ditto.

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-sheet.c
	(gnucash_sheet_deactivate_cursor_cell): New function.
	(gnucash_sheet_activate_cursor_cell):
	(gnucash_sheet_cursor_move):
	(gnucash_sheet_start_editing_at_cursor):
	(gnucash_sheet_stop_editing):

1999-08-09  Heath Martin  <martinh@pegasus.cc.ucf.edu>

	* src/register/gnome/combocell-gnome.c: New file, everything is a
	no-op for now, we just need the stubs.

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-item-edit.[ch]: New file.  Implements
	an entry for the sheet.

1999-08-08  Heath Martin  <martinh@pegasus.cc.ucf.edu>

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-cursor.[ch] : New file.  Implements a
	block/cell cursor.

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-sheet.c
	(gnucash_sheet_style_get_cell_pixel_rel_coords): New function.

1999-08-06  Heath Martin  <martinh@pegasus.cc.ucf.edu>

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-grid.c (gnucash_grid_draw): Updated
	to reflect the changes below.
	(gnucash_grid_find_block_origin_by_pixel): Bug fix (off by one).

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-sheet.c (gnucash_sheet_table_load):
	Another overhaul of the structure.  We need to keep a local copy
	of the table, to keep what we need to redraw from changing
	underneath us.  So we needed some memory management and some minor
	API adjustments.
	(gnucash_sheet_resize):
	(gnucash_sheet_resize_row):
	(gnucash_sheet_destroy_row):
	(gnucash_sheet_block_new_row):
	(gnucash_sheet_block_set_from_table):
	(gnucash_sheet_block_set_entries):
	(gnucash_sheet_block_clear_entries):
	(gnucash_sheet_insert_block_row):
	(gnucash_sheet_get_block):

1999-08-04  Heath Martin  <martinh@pegasus.cc.ucf.edu>

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-sheet.c
	(gnucash_sheet_compute_visible_range): New

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-grid.c (gnucash_grid_draw): Basic
	support for drawing the text of a cell.
	(gnucash_grid_draw): Added support for justifications.

1999-08-03  Heath Martin  <martinh@pegasus.cc.ucf.edu>

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-sheet.c (gnucash_register_new): Make
	register into an independent widget.

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-sheet.c, gnucash-grid.c: Overhaul of
	the structure.  We don't need to keep a list of blocks, or a hash
	list of styles.  All the info we need is in the Table, and there
	are only five styles associated to a given table (from
	splitreg.h).  Many functions touched to reflect the change.  Also,
	keep track of the SplitRegister associated to this table.

1999-08-02  Heath Martin  <martinh@pegasus.cc.ucf.edu>

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-color.c (gnucash_color_init): move
	the color allocation and hash table routines from table-gnome.c to
	here.

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-sheet.c (gnucash_sheet_block_append):
	fixed a silly bug.
	(gnucash_sheet_block_style_new): Fix up the key.
	(gnucash_register_new): This is complex widget that already has
	the vertical/horizontal scrollbars attached.

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-grid.c (gnucash_grid_find_block): Be
	sure we get a valid sheet_block.  Our register window may be
	larger than the number of blocks.

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-sheet.c (gnucash_sheet_load): Initial
	load of the table into the register.

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-color.[c,h]:  steal these files from gnumeric

1999-08-01  Heath Martin  <martinh@pegasus.cc.ucf.edu>

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-sheet.c
	(gnucash_sheet_style_recompile): make height, width a member of
	the style, so we don't have to change every block when the style
	gets recompiled (on sheet allocation changes for example).

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-grid.c (gnucash_grid_get_type): First
	hack at getting a grid going.
	(gnucash_grid_class_init): Ditto
	(gnucash_grid_set_arg):
	(gnucash_grid_init):
	(gnucash_grid_draw):
	(gnucash_grid_find_block):
	(gnucash_grid_update):
	(gnucash_grid_unrealize):
	(gnucash_grid_realize):

	* src/register/gnome/gnucash-sheet.c (gnucash_sheet_new): New
	(gnucash_sheet_get_type): New
	(gnucash_sheet_class_init): New
	(gnucash_sheet_create): New
	(gnucash_sheet_realize): New
	(gnucash_sheet_block_new): New
	(gnucash_sheet_block_destroy): New
	(gnucash_sheet_vadjustment_value_changed): New
	(gnucash_sheet_set_top_block): New
	(gnucash_sheet_block_get_pixels): New
	(gnucash_sheet_get_block): New
	(gnucash_sheet_style_init): etc, per block style handling
