# Notes:
# 1. for this script to work, git must have been setup before
#    in a way that doesn't conflict with the GnuCash build.
#    The easiest way to do so is to run the build once manually
#    with a properly set up custom.sh.
#
# 2. Should this script change in the source repository, then the
#    git pull below will fail due to a limitation in Windows that
#    won't allow to change a file that is "in use". So in the rare
#    situation this script needs to be updated, you will need to
#    run the git pull once yourself.
