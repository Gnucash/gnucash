\section qifintro 0. Introduction

The existing qif importer in src/import-export/qif-import is both hard
to maintain and hard to re-integrate into the shared import
architecture.  Similarly, the half-completed re-write in qif-io-core
is similarly hard to maintain (although it is arguably easier to
integrate).  One problem with both of these solutions is that they are
written in Scheme, a language that many gnucash developers just don't
understand well.  Another issue is that the code is not commented and
no documentation exists to help future developers track down bugs or
extend the importer as QIF changes over time (c.f. Memorized
Transaction import).

As much as "complete rewrite" tends to be a lot of work for little
gain, when few (if any) developers can understand the implementation
well enough to make changes, a complete re-write may make sense.  This
document is an attempt to describe the architecture of the new
importer, implemented in C, and how it interfaces to the rest of the
import infrastructure.


\section qifarch 1. Importer Architecture

The importer is a multi-step, staged system that should implement a
read, parse, convert, combine, filter, finish process.  The importer
starts with a clean import context and then each processing step
modifies it as per the user's requirements.  A small set of APIs allow
the user to progress along the processing steps (and an internal state
machine makes sure the caller proceeds in the proper order).

The importer is driven by the UI code; the importer itself is just a
multi-stage worker.  The UI code calls each step in the process.  For
long-running operations the UI can provide a callback mechanism for a
progress bar of completion.

Each stage of the import process may require some user input.  What
input is required depends on the stage of the process and what the
last stage returned.  In some cases stages can be skipped.  For
example, during the conversion phase if the date format is unambigious
then no user input would be required and the "ask for date format
disamiguation" input can be skipped.

QUESTION: How does the importer relate the processing state back to
the UI?  Simiarly, how does it pass back specific disambiguating
questions to ask the user (and how are those responses returned to the
importer)?

\section qifprocess 2. The Import Process

The import process starts when the UI creates a new import context.
All of a single import is performed within that context.  The context
model allows multiple import processes to take place simultaneously.

The first step in the import process is selecting the file (or files)
to be imported.  The UI passes each filename to the importer which
reads the file and performs a quick parse process to break the file
down into its component QIF parts.  While the importer should allow
the user to iteratively add more and more files to the import context,
it should also allow the user to select multiple files at once
(e.g. *.qif) to reduce the user workload.

Each imported file may be a complete QIF file or it may be a single
QIF account file.  In the latter case the UI needs to ask the user for
the actual QIF account name for the file.  Similarly, each file may
need user intervention to disambiguate various data, like the date or
number formats.

QUESTION: If the user provides multiple files at once and each file
has internal ambiguities (e.g. the date format), should the user be
asked for each file, or can we assume that all the files have the same
format?  Perhaps the UI should allow the user to "make this choice for
all files"?

Once the user chooses all their files (they can also remove files
during the process) the importer will combine the files into a common
import, trying to match QIF accounts and transactions from different
files.  Part of this is duplicate detection, because QIF only includes
half a transaction (for any QIF transaction you only know the local
account, not necessarily the "far" account).  If the importer sees
multiple parts of the same transaction it can (and should) combine
them into a single transaction, thereby pinning down the near and far
accounts.

The next series of steps maps QIF data objects to GnuCash data
objects.  In particular, the importer needs the help of the UI to map
unknown QIF Accounts and Categories to GnuCash Accounts (the latter to
Income and Expense Accounts) and QIF Securities to GnuCash
Commodities.  Finally the importer can use the generic transaction
matcher to map the existing transactions to potential duplicates and
also Payee/Memo fields to "destination accounts".

At the end of this process the accounts, commodities, and transactions
are merged into the existing account tree, and the import context is
freed.

\section qifstate 5. Importer State Machine

The state machine has the following structure.  Named states (and substates)
must proceed in order.  Some states (e.g. state b) have multiple choices.
For example you could enter substates b1-b2, or you can run qif_file_remove.

a. Create the context
   - qif_context_create
b. Add/Remove files to be imported
   b1. Add file
       - qif_file_new
   b2. Parse the added file
       - qif_file_parse
         Note that this needs to callback into the ui to handle ambiguities
   - qif_file_remove
     If the user wants to remove some files from the import context
   - repeat (b) as necessary until user choses to move to (c)
c. Once all files are chosen, merge internally and continue the process
   - qif_context_merge_files
d. map qif accounts to gnucash accounts
e. map qif categories to gnucash accounts
f. map qif securities to gnucash commodities
g. duplicate detection with existing gnucash txns
h. transaction matcher (map one-sided txns using Payee/Memo info)
