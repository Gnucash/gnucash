The following bugs have been fixed:
    Bug 605602 - precision of Financial Calculator seems to depend on
                 locale
    Bug 746937 - Template transaction splits are loaded in reverse order
                 and then not sorted before saving. Actually not sorted
                 after loading because the template accounts weren't being
                 committed.
    Bug 752395 - Start Day of weekly report doesn't respond to change in
                 locale
                 Redefines some functions to ensure weekly grouping in
                 transaction report obeys locale's start-of-week.
    Bug 784623 - GNUCash does not work with sql backend, I can open
                 in read only mode. Upgrade the splits table as well, an
                 oversight from the original fix.
    Bug 793018 - Balance (with >>eguile<<) - Report Title can't be changed
    Bug 795251 - googletest detection cannot be overridden
    Bug 796819 - bad icon with Spanish localization
                 Temporary fix for Farsi, which was affected, too. As it
                 is maintained by TP, the final fix has to come from them.
    Bug 796952 - Report formatting (justify) is broken
                 Previous patch reverted and replaced with a more correct one.
    Bug 797085 - Import Bills & Invoices – headers not translated.
                 Make strings translatable. Translators: This adds 22 new
                 translatable strings.
    Bug 797158 - gnc:make-account-sel-limited-option is not working
                 Option was being deliberately reset to default_value every
                 time.
    Bug 797171 - Allow multiple credit/debit columns to be selected
    Bug 797279 - Reports RTL do not support RTL - fix reports
    Bug 797279 - Reports RTL do not support RTL - fix string
                 fix guile-2.0 string handling to prevent munging unicode
                 in report-titles etc. while loading/saving reports
    Bug 797295 - problems with entering swedish åäö in company address
    Bug 797297 - GNUCash is in English even though MacOS is set-up to
                 French.
    Bug 797301 - Register Menu View > Refresh doesn't work in 'with
                 sub-accounts' window
    Bug 797306 - "URL cannot be shown" when one clicks an account line
                 link in report.
    Bug 797316 - New Mauritanian ouguiya MRU not supported
    Bug 797319 - Mauritanian ouguiya MRO shows too few decimals
    Bug 797339 - Online banking frame to small
    Bug 797349 - "A"ssociate header badly translated.
                 Note to translators: This is about msgids of the form
                 "Associate:A". The correct msgstr includes the part up to
                 the ':' verbatim with only the part to the right of it
                 translated, e.g. "Associate:П" from uk.po. Each such msgstr
                 has a comment explaining this.
    Bug 797353 - Add copyright and release info in appdata file
    Bug 797355 - General Journal report seems to be off balance
                 Previously, for general-journal, each split was being
                 analyzed, and only the source split was counted for
                 totals. This change will means the source split *and* its
                 peers are accounted for.
    Bug 797377 - cmake fails on debian-8 and ubuntu-14.04 with
                 gnucash.appdata.xml.in does not exist
    Bug 797378 - QIF file import fails: Loading gives wrong type argument
                 in position 2
    Bug 797389 - Random Crashes while attaching a document.

Other repairs or enhancements not marked as bugs:
    New feature: Multiselection in the import transaction matcher. Use
      control-left-click, shift-left-click, or click-and-drag to select
      multiple unmatched transactions to match them with a single account,
      then right-click to bring up a single-item context menu sith
      "Assign Transfer Account".
    Set a FinTS product version key when the installed AQBanking supports it.
    Reworking of many translatable strings with context to use the modern
      gettext three-parameter function instead of the ':' hack noted in
      bug 797349.
    Stop duplicate entries for the invoice taxtable cell
    Do not log an error when no default tax tables are set.
    Fix cmake dependency tree so that make/ninja check works without having
      to first run make/ninja.
    Remove the accelerator for the Clear buttons on the Loan Calculator
      because they were all the same and also the same as the Close button's
      accelerator.
    Change the transfer account notation for single-split transactions in
      basic view from "--Split Transaction--" (they're obviously not) to "None".
    Correctly parse decimal values between 0 and -1 (e.g. -0.5) in register
      calculations: The negative sign was being stripped.
    Require CMake 3.5 or later for all platforms.
    Rework the building of libgtest.a from source when the builder sets
      GTEST_ROOT or the distro doesn't provide a pre-build one.
    Fix crash when trying to display a tooltip in the register split view
      when a split has focus.
    Fix repeated requests to create a new account when you click No.
    Suppress bogus error when creating a new account from register split view.
    Fix price conversion report crashes in Balance Sheet PNL and all
      average balance calculations.
    Upgrade the Budget reports to support accumulated accounts.
    Redefine gnc:debug to use QofLog instead of writing to stdout.
    Change the Balance Sheet PNL account depth to mean the deepest *selected*
      account rather than the deepest account.
    Set the Owner Report date option to default to today.
    Much Scheme cleanup and more testing.

                 account picker dialog is presented, add an error dialog

                 account is a placeholder.

    Bug 797266 - Missing translation settings
    Bug 797277 - Assets over time ignores nested liabilities
    Bug 797278 - Create an option for type of commodity for Price import
                 Currently when you use the 'Commodity From' column for
                 Price imports it can match against the wrong commodity
                 like COP (Conoco Philips) would match against the currency
                 COP (Columbian Peso). To fix this add a new column type
                 'From Namespace' and rename 'Commodity From' to 'From
                 Symbol' so they match the Security Editor.
    Bug 797281 - Gnucash crashes when attempting to match online accounts

Other repairs or enhancements not marked as bugs:

    Rewrite the Customer Summary Report to correctly handle multiple currencies.
    Improve the Owner Report's find-first function to consider currency when
        selecting the account.
    Prevent cutting the "anchor" split or pasting another split on top of
        it in account registers so that the transaction won't suddenly
        disappear from the register page. Displays an explanatory dialog just
        like trying to delete the anchor split does. Allow deleting, cutting,
        and pasting over all splits in Journal View registers which don't have
        anchor splits because they're not associated with any account.
    Disable editing the "blank split" (the new split at the bottom of a
        transaction in split view) if the transaction itself is read-only.
    Use the customer and vendor currency instead of the default currency from
        preferences when generating bills, invoices, or credit notes.
    Allow assigning a single target account to more than one transaction in
        the import matcher. To do this select the new transactions and
        right-click to open a single-item context menu. Click the menu item
        to open the account selection dialog box. Note that imported
        transactions that match transactions already in the eriger,
        i.e. those marked "update" or "reconcile and update" are not eligible
        for inclusion.
        This feature still has some rough edges that are being addressed for
        the next release.
    Use the default currency from Properties>Accounts for the summary bar
        currency to make it configurable.
    Allow CSV export of grand total amounts from reports using the trep-engine.
    Fix XML file import failures into GnuCash for Android.
    Raise minimum CMake version to 3.5 for all platforms.
    Prevent crash in Aging Report when the book has no AP or AR accounts.
    Fix operation of the "default budget" option.
    Change the account-picker dialog to disable the OK button instead of
        raising a warning dialog if the selected account is a placeholder.
    Fix crash after unloading all files from the QIF import assistant.
    Disable the Next button in the QIF import assistant if no files are
        selected for import.
    New report "Balance Sheet-PNL" combines a Balance Sheet and an Income
        Statement in a single report.
    Rework localization in C++ on Win32 builds, fixing several crashes and
        speeding up file loading by 10x.
    Create a console window for displaying stdout/stderr. Define
        __MSWIN_CONSOLE__ and recompile to enable.
    Keep the selection in the Securities Editor on the commodity after
        editing it.
    Allow the Securities Editor to stack separately from the main window.
    Much more Scheme cleanup and refactoring.
    Python console improvements, including switching to Python3 and not
        killing GnuCash when quitting the console.

3.5 - 31 March 2019
The sixth release of the 3.x stable series.

Note for Windows and MacOS users: The Gtk GUI framework has fixed
several substantial bugs in the Windows and MacOS backends, some of
which are so recent that they are not included in the latest
release. In order to ensure that the GnuCash all-in-one bundles have
those important fixes we are departing from normal practice and
shipping builds from the Gtk repository instead of from release
tarballs.

The following bugs have been fixed:
    Bug 639049 - Asset Barchart Report includes also the first day of next month transactions
  If the original date is an end-of-month date, we take it as an
  indicator they always want monthdelta dates to be end-of-months.
  This works for monthly/quarterly/halfyearly/annual.
    Bug 748431 - Wrong average balance for transactions during DST
  Replace average-splits with custom loop, cycling through the
  balancelist and splitlist, creating interval summaries along the way.
    Bug 787401 - Test for the report system - HTML Tests.
    Bug 795729 - Advanced Portfolio Report - Percentage rates not displaying leading zeros.
    Bug 796498 - Incorrect starting balance in TXF Report calculations.
    Bug 796530 - TxnCsvImport - fix loading of saved preset with update of separator selection. Previously this would cause all but the first column to lose its assigned types.
    Bug 796687 - Tax Entity name and type for an account won't work under "Tax Reporting Options" in Gnucash 3.2
    Bug 796826 - Report HTML - not possible to suppress the document header.
    Bug 796827 - Report HTML - it is not possible to suppress the document title.
    Bug 796829 - Report HTML - HTML table rows are prepended not as list elements
    Bug 796831 - Report-HTML - append table column correctly.
    Bug 796877 - test-stress-options fails.
    Bug 796946 - Mortgage and Loan Repayment Setup tool crashes when exiting "Loan Repayment Options" page.
  Because libstdc++ on Windows doesn't support any C++ locales besides "C" and throws an exception if you try.
    Bug 796952 - Report formatting (justify) is broken.
    Bug 796956 - Aqbanking 6 will drop DTAUS
                 Adds support for the upcoming AQBanking 6 and removes support for AQBanking earlier than 5.3.4.
    Bug 796965 - Change the default to show unused accounts.
    Bug 796989 - some date/time does not honor user locale.
    Bug 797002 - Program crashes when exporting tax data in txf format.
    Bug 797011 - GnuCash 3.4 Crashes When Printing Checks with Custom Format.
    Bug 797013 - Import Customers & Vendors: error in CMakeLists.txt - causes incomplete project in Xcode.
    Bug 797029 - Import Customer & Vendors: blank name and company in import data row crashes GnuCash
    Bug 797030 - Import Customer & Vendors: several issues with the matching of data rows.
    Bug 797031 - Import customer & Vendors: import can create customer and vendors without address data
    Bug 797041 - enum confusion in qoflog.
    Bug 797046 - Tools / Price Database / Currencies UI not working since 3.4.
    Bug 797067 - Date displayed incorrectly in register.
    Bug 797074 - Reports with averages are displaying fractions
                 Convert amounts to decimal prior to adding to html-table.  Also adds tests to make sure averages are displayed in 2 decimal places.
    Bug 797098 - Quitting Gnucash shortly after clicking Save may abort file save.
    Bug 797105 - Incorrect local-symbol for SZL currency
    Bug 797136 - Balance sheet report "Show Exchange rate" broken when foreign currency is sold completely
                 For cases where total(amount)/total(value) = 0/0, the price is reported as 0.

Other repairs or enhancements not marked as bugs:

    API: Add dedicated api to query build-time, version related compile constants and use it in several location in the code for consistent behaviour.
    Budget: Save and restore the Account filter settings.
    Build: Fix deprecation warnings for g_type_class_add_private.

    CSV Tokenizer: Add additional test to guard against quote parsing regressions.
    GUI: Replace ambiguous mnemonic for File>Export>Export Active Register...
    GUI: Rearrange menu accelerators for Actions>Online Actions menu items
    GUI: Add mnemonic for File>Import>Import Bills...
    GUI: Move Balance-Forecast report to Reports>Assets & Liabilities
    GUI: Move Void Transactions item in Report Options from the Accounts tab to the Filter tab.
    I18N: Fix erratic localization of dates on Windows.
      Date format selection on Windows relies on Windows National Language functions and those are unaffected by the POSIX setlocale(). We have in the past relied upon gtk initialization to handle this but it has not been reliable since the move to Gtk3. Note that this applies only when the locale is set via a Unix-style environment variable (typically LANG) or in the environment file; it's unnecessary and ignored when using the localization settings in Region & Language.
    I18N: Unify phrases to remove untranslated msgids.
    I18N: Restore the global locale after Guile munges it.
      There's no way to change the environment locale on Windows so calling setlocale(LC_ALL, ""), as guile does in its init routine, reads the user's Language and Region settings instead of the environment variables. We save the discovered environment locale and call setlocale with it again after Guile has initialized.
    Importing: Remove old (non-SEPA) online transaction code, because now in 2019 the banks will only offer SEPA transactions and no others. This in turn means we don't need the old ktoblzcheck checking functions at all so also remove the dependency.
    Importing: Usability improvements for Bayes editor window
      Remove the "Are you sure" question as it is simply annoying but does not help. Fix some string wordings to be more understandable.
    Online Banking: No longer force existence of local BIC code.
    Online Banking: Entering of TAN must use normal visibility
      The visibility of the entered content was set to FALSE (=invisible) always, which was wrong for certain types of input as indicated by the GUI_INPUT_FLAGS. This should now be honored and visibility set to TRUE (=visible) for the correct flags.
    Online Banking: Fix reconcile timestamps when importing balances.
      Used to be start-of-day, but needs to be day-neutral.
    Performance: Provide a single static instance of C++ locale.
      We can't use std::locale::global because all streams imbue it by default and if it's not 'C' (aka std::locale::classic) then we must imbue all the streams that we don't want localized, and that's most of them.
    Performance: Add GncDateTime::timestamp().
      To provide a C++ implementation of gnc_date_timestamp and to avoid using the expensive and localized GncDateTime::format().
    Performance: Implement a faster date-time serialization function.
      Has the side effect of recording all date-times in XML files in UTC instead of local time with a timezone. This will help users who like to keep their files under version control because the time strings won't shift every time Daylight time begins or ends.
    Performance: >Fix XML load CPU hotspot: Scrub.c xaccTransScrubPostedDate
      The refactoring provides roughly 10% reduction in user CPU use for XML file load by moving an expensive function to within an if-clause where the result is used.
    Performance: Speed-up of txn match dialog: Suspend GUI refresh during deletion of selected lines.
    Performance: Sorting speed-up: Cache the bool value of Transaction's is_closing property.
    Register: Accept URLs or file paths for files associated with transactions. File paths can be relative or absolute. A preference is provided.
    Reports: Speed up the budget and cash flow report calculation by iterating over accounts only once.
    Reports: Heavy scrubbing for code readability and performance.
    Reports: New Report by Ryan Turner: Balance Forecast Report
      This report forecasts the combined balances of the selected accounts based on the scheduled transactions and plots them on a line graph. You can set a "reserve" amount, which will draw a red line on the graph, so you can easily see if your forecast dips below a given value. There is also a "future minimum" line which shows what the lowest future balance will be at a given point. I find this useful in conjunction with the "target" line for planning.
    Reports: Fix crash when loading saved-report with unknown choices.
      If a saved-report with e.g. relative date, multichoice option is unknown, the report would crash, and the Report-Options would segfault. This commit fixes both: report-date defaults to 'today', multichoice-options defaults to default-value. Following this commit, if a report loads a saved-report or .gcm from a future version, a gnc:warn will be emitted and the report will not crash; it will use relative-date today. Multichoice will remain the default value. Report Options will not segfault. The user will be notified via a gnc:gui-warn dialog
    Reports: Date intervals at end-of-month:
      Instead of recursing the date, we calculate the next month using an index-based multiplier, and apply modulo/remainder as appropriate to determine the next month/year. Then we attempt to create new mktime, and if the resulting mktime's month is not as expected, reduce the mday by 1 until resulting month is correct. This fixes monthly intervals for end-of-month days. Test via monthly/quarterly deltas, and also includes leapyear calculation.
    Reports: Date-grouping must allow indenting.
      Indenting checkbox was erroneously disabled when: sortkey = date, date-subtotal = not 'none.
    Reports: Table display
      It is intuitive that if the user wishes to show the subtotal-table, and hide the transactions, then both the main (hidden) transactions and subtotals must be hidden as well.
    Reports: Update US Income Tax information for 2018.

    Scheme: Replace account and split utility functions with SRFI-1 functions.
    Scheme: Testing (create-transaction) adds price trading commodities/currency this will modify a test which was calibrated to record purchase price only. fix transaction creation to add prices for both purchase and sales, and also fix test which was assuming no sale price was bring recorded.
    Scheme: Testing (env-create-multisplit-transaction) This is the general case for any transaction creation.  Rewrite other transaction creation routines to use it.  All tests still work unchanged, which confirms this function works well. This will allow tests to create multisplit transactions, of an arbitrary number of splits. If the list-of-split's values are not balanced (i.e. total 0), the engine will create an Imbalance-CUR split.
       The motivation is to allow creation of complex multisplit multicommodity transactions eg USD50 + GBP20 (USD25) = EUR66 (USD75) as well as their prices GBP/USD = 25/20 and EUR/USD = 75/66.
        * USD -50
        * USD -25 = GBP -20
        * USD +75 = EUR +66
       This will be useful in creating tests for stock-based reports, whereby stock sales need splits in STOCK/ASSET/INCOME accounts.
    Scheme: Redesign gnc:account-get-balances-at-dates, replacing the ignore-closing? parameter with a split->amount function parameter having a default value of xaccSplitgetAmount. (split->amount split) should return the amount of the split or #f; in the latter case the split is skipped. This allows for a more general account balance list accumulator with novel balance strategies. For example a split->amount function could test void status and return xaccSplitVoidFormerAmount on void splits; test description/memo for some content and vary the returned amount accordingly; or test the split and return 1 or 0 creating a counter. To recreate the ignore-closing use case pass (lambda (s) (and not (xaccTransGetIsClosingTxn (xaccSplitGetParent s))) (xaccSplitGetAccount s)))
    Scheme: Replace some option names. Automatically convert usage of the old names and issue a warning.

Other repairs or enhancements not marked as bugs:
     Set up filepath utils to determine the GNC_CONFIG_HOME in the same way
          as GNC_DATA_HOME
          Until now GNC_CONFIG_HOME was more or less hard-coded. Now it can be
          set via environment variable GNC_CONFIG_HOME. In addition it will
          automatically be created to avoid potential user confusion.
     Redesign gnc-uri-utils
          gnc_uri_get_components will now return NULL as protocol if the input
               is a normal file system path instead of a uri (it used to
               return 'file')
          gnc_uri_get_protocol will now return NULL if the input is a normal
               file system path instead of a uri (it used to return 'file')
          gnc_uri_is_file_protocol now returns FALSE if protocol is NULL
               (it used to return TRUE)
           gnc_uri_is_file_uri now returns FALSE if input is a normal file
                system path instead of a uri (it used to return TRUE)
           a new function gnc_uri_targets_local_fs will return TRUE only if
                its input is either a file uri or a normal file system path.
                This function is now mostly used instead of
                gnc_uri_is_file_uri in the current code base
           a new function gnc_uri_is_uri is added to check whether its input
                is a valid uri (has protocol, path and hostname for non-file
                uris)
           refer to 'scheme' instead of 'protocol' as that's the more formal
               term used in uris
               This involves renaming 3 functions:
                    gnc_uri_get_protocol -> gnc_uri_get_scheme
                    gnc_uri_is_known_protocol -> gnc_uri_is_known_scheme
                    gnc_uri_is_file_protocol -> gnc_uri_is_file_scheme
               The *_protocol variants are marked as deprecated.
               Additionally a number of local variables have been renamed from
               protocol to scheme to support this change.
     Show warnings for deprecated declarations
          We're about to announce our own set of deprecated functions in
          libgnucash. That would be pretty pointless if we also would silence
          all deprecation warnings at the same time...
     More report code-cleanup by Chris Lam, including deprecating the
           following functions:
               gnc:account-get-balance-at-date
               gnc:account-get-total-flow
               gnc-commodity-numeric-string
               gnc-commodity-value->string
               gnc:double-col
               gnc:options-add-include-subaccounts
               gnc:options-add-group-accounts
               gnc:options-add-currency-selection
            The following modules are deprecated:
               report-system/collectors
               report-system/report-collectors
     Invoice: Remove H1 title and superfluous option.
           Printing the title twice is silly, so remove the option and the
           H1 display of the title. Note that the remaining title is in a
           div named "invoice-title" so it can be styled with CSS as the user
           pleases from the Report Options Layout tab.
     The preference, use formal accounting labels does not update the header
          With a register open and you change preference 'use formal
          accounting labels' it does not update the register header so add
         a call back for the preference.

     Make the grid lines of totals Budget tree view track the preferences
          Make the grid lines of the totals tree view track the preferences
          to match the account tree view above it.
     Add routine to fix Account Color being set to "Not Set"
          Previously the account color slot has been populated with
          "Not Set" when any field for the account has been edited and
          saved. This routine should run once and remove all such entries.
     Performance fix in dom_chars_handler: use g_strndup instead of g_strdup
     In the appdata/metadata file, rename the ID from org.gnucash.Gnucash
          to org.gnucash.GnuCash to match flathub, and add a launchable ID
          to link it to the desktop file.
     Added double-click-on-file for the CSV transaction, price, and account
         importers and exporters.
     Cleaned up a variety of issues reported by the clang static analyzer.
     Allow the text options widget to use all remaining space
          The text option widget used for report options has only about 3
          lines visible currently and will not use any available space in
          the dialogue. Change the packing for this widget to expand and
          fill the remaining dialogue space. If there are more than one text
          option widget on a page then the available space will be shared
          equally.
     Add short_labels for a few toolbar buttons with long names. That should
          fit a few more buttons on the toolbar.
     Update iso-4217-currencies.xml, adding VES - Bolivar Soberano, minor
          updates of other VE currencies.
     Python 3 bindings fixes and improvements from Christoph Holtermann and
          Sumit Bhardwaj.

3.3 - 30 September 2018

                 linked to reconciled splits.
    Bug 784420 - "Save changes on closing" window waits 2^32 seconds when
                 "Time to wait for answer" is set 0.
    Bug 786708 - GnuCash won't load currency fractions larger than 1000000.
                 Also create larger fractions for the account dialog.
    Bug 787439 - Segmentation Fault in Transfer dialog after clearing Date field
                 and pressing escape.
    Bug 789594 - Unable to overwrite sqlite3 database file.
    Bug 792446 - Mixed languages in error dialog.
    Bug 794526 - Python bindings can't find loadable modules.
    Bug 794755 - Commodity Register displays fractional prices.
                 Prices will now be displayed in decimal, rounded to two more
                 places than the currency's smallest unit.
    Bug 794870 - If no book is opened, gnucash still asks if the user wants
                 to save changes when opening a file.
    Bug 795821 - GnuCash could not obtain the lock for
                 file://C:\Users\username\Documents\GnuCash\2.6.21\xxxx\xxxx.gnucash
    Bug 796054 - Unposting and reposting invoice doubles amounts.
                 Add scrub function to unblock the double post transaction
    Bug 796137 - query.search_for outputs critical qof.object errors and
                 prevents queries being run.
    Bug 796248 - Editing Scheduled Transaction.
                 In addition to not beginning to edit already-loaded
                 transactions, don't try to load splits that are already
                 loaded. It shouldn't be possible to load a transaction
                 without also loading its splits.
    Bug 796474 - Segmentation fault while setting up online banking.
                 Allow only a single instance of the assistant.
    Bug 796509 - Saved reports don't respect *some* 'Edit report options'.
    Bug 796579 - Cannot go forward with empty duplicates screen.
    Bug 796665 - Backspace Key Inoperable After Ctrl+V.
    Bug 796669 - Dark Theme Text Colors Hard to Read.
                 Only add the register-foreground class when using Gnucash built
                 in colors. When this setting not used, the foreground color
                 by default will be what ever the theme has set and will be
                 down to the user to over ride along with the other register
                 colors.
    Bug 796724 - Can't overwrite gnucash DB on MariaDB.
    Bug 796725 - 4 of 6 Date Posted options fail to return matching
                 transactions.
    Bug 796734 - Auto-complete entry not highlighting to allow for incremental
                 entry.
    Bug 796737 - Patch to restore gncmod-python.c.
    Bug 796739 - Toolbar buttons have no labels.
    Bug 796751 - reconcile window usability - R column should be next to Amount.
    Bug 796755 - buggy window handling at startup.
    Bug 796756 - OFX import fails to recognize associated income accounts.
    Bug 796759 - --add-price-quotes <sql file> leaves a lock on the file.
    Bug 796762 - Scrollbar partially hides the delete button in  the Saved
                 Report Configurations window.
                 The vertical scrollbar obscures the delete button in the tree
                 view so add a dummy blank column to the end and set it to the
                 width of the vertical scrollbar.
    Bug 796766 - Credit note creating 'imbalance' with wrong entries
    Bug 796777 - CVE-2008-1391: Integer overflow in included strfmon function.
    Bug 796788 - Strange behaviour in options of multicolumn report.
    Bug 796792 - SaveAs Overwrite dialogue in background and not visible.
    Bug 796812 - gnc_date_cell_get_date and gnc_date_cell_get_date_gdate have
                 different date validation behaviour.
    Bug 796813 - Date validation inconsistent.
    Bug 796814 - Changing a book's read-only threshold doesn't immediately
                 affect open registers.
    Bug 796816 - Notes field in Duplicate Invoice dialogue is 'read-only'.
    Bug 796819 - Bad icon with Spanish localization.
                 Drop translations of the 'gnucash-icon' string from our po
                 files and add a note for translators to not translate this
                 string or use the literal 'gnucash-icon' as translation.
    Bug 796820 - References to 'Gnome Bugzilla' should be changed to
                 'GnuCash Bugzilla'.
    Bug 796833 - Excel csv Format misprocessed.
                 Convert all line ending styles to the one expected by the C++
                 standard library before starting to parse a csv file.
    Bug 796839 - Find transaction won't filter on Date Posted.
    Bug 796858 - TypeError: in method 'qof_query_int32_predicate', argument 2 of
                 type 'gint32' on gnucash.gnucash_core.QueryInt32Predicate.

Other repairs or enhancements not marked as bugs:

    Set toolbar buttons to show both icon and text.
        And make the icon small to recover some vertical screen estate. The
        motivation for this is that Gtk has dropped the ability for users
        to change a toolbar's appearance. And as our icons are often less than
        descriptive many users benefit from having textual descriptions as
        well. This is the best compromise we can make until the gui gets an
        in-depth redesign.
    Add preference for forcing prices to decimal display.
        Anticipating that some users might prefer to see exact prices, add
        a preference to General>Numbers to configure whether prices are
        rounded to decimals or are displayed as exact fractions.
    Revert the "Average Cost" pricing changes made in 2.6.17.
        These changes broke trial balances in many books.
    Allow saving to xml over an existing sqlite3 file and the other way around.
    Add customer/vendor ID in client section of invoices.
        Partly fixes bugs 430259 and 742086; full fixes would require
        not-backward-compatible data model changes.
    Change the default filter for General Ledger.
        The General Ledger default for the number of days shown is 30 but
        for the Register it is 0, meaning show all. So change the default
        filter based on ledger type and use this when determining if the
        setting should be saved or removed.
    Fix gtk accelerator mixups by explicitly disabling actions that are not
        relevant. For example, File->Print and its variants for various page
        types all use the same '<primary>p' as global accelerator. It was
        possible to have gnucash invoke the 'Print Report...' action instead
        of the 'Print Invoice...' action when hitting <primary>p on an invoice
        page. If no report page was open at this point, gnucash would crash.
        If a report was open, gnucash would invoke the print action on that
        report instead of opening an invoice report for the invoice.
    [job-report] Prevent Crash if there is no AR account
    Add the ability to cascade account colors in account tree.
        The color on an account that has sub-accounts can be applied to its
        sub-accounts; by default only those sub-accounts that don't have a
        color set are affected, but there's a preference to override that.
    Speed up loading the preference dialog by blocking register updates until
        the dialog is fully loaded.
    Update change_tax_code.py, add basic test for python query.
    Simplify GNCQueryView's data model: It was managing a number of redundant
        parameters which were leaking memory all over the place. The information
        that was tracked could easily be extracted from the underlying
        GtkTreeView, GtkTreeModel or GtkTreeSelection when needed.
    Open customer/vendor/employee report when double-clicking an the
        respective owner the cust/vend/empl overview page.
    Update Overview of README based on https://lists.gnucash.org/pipermail/gnucash-devel/2018-September/042748.html
    Many new tests for reports.
    Some substantial speedups when loading large amounts of business
        transactions from a SQL backend.
    Clean up a lot of memory leaks.
    Remove all use of Timespec in the program. Provide deprecated wrapper
        functions supporting timespecs for custom reports; users should update
        the reports as soonas possible.

3.2 - 25 June 2018
The third release of the 3.x stable series.

The following bugs have been fixed:
    Bug 787401 - Test Report System - Report Definition.
    Bug 794617 - Can't compile with -DWITH_GNUCASH=NO due to scm-gnome-utils.
    Bug 795101 - Scroll Bar in Reconcile Window Floats in and covers the check
        boxes.
    Bug 795247 - datepicker broken in Persian.
             GnuCash passes dates as integer y/m/d without using locale-specific
             formats, so we need to strip out 'E' and 'O' from the format when
             scanning dates or determining separators in gnc-date. None of '-',
             'E', or 'O' are supported by boost (and '-' causes errors), so
             strip them out from formatters in gnc-datetime as well.
    Bug 795253 - Have problems input Chinese.
    Bug 795272 - QIF importer causes application crash if action is invalid.
    Bug 795276 - Invalid date on price stops file from being parsed.
    Bug 795362 - Special variable "i" not parsed in function calls.
             Due to balance tests with insane random values.
    Bug 795471 - Impossible to Edit Budget Unless Maximized.
    Bug 795519 - Credit card payment after reconciliation.
    Bug 795666 - Backslash '\' in Description field spoils CSV Import without
        helpful error message.
    Bug 795831 - When read only threshold set, dates are silently changed.
             Display a message box informing the user of the change.
    Bug 795944 - Cannot store change to Business Suppliers data.
    Bug 796079 - Repeatable Crash in Tax Report Options.
    Bug 796081 - Tax Schedule Report - An error occurred while running the report.
    Bug 796083 - Reconcile Selection Doesn't Work Anymore.
    Bug 796117 - Connecting 3.1 to an existing mysql db drops all data
             Provide a backup recovery function that instead of dropping
             primaries and restoring backups merges the primaries and
             backups. This should handle a worst-case safe-save failure where
             the backup tables don't have a complete set of rows for some
             reason.
    Bug 796256 - Main Window stays hidden when starting after closing main
        window while minimized.
    Bug 796369 - Notes lost or perhaps just not displaying when using SQLite
        backend.
             This bug caused data loss if you saved your SQLite3 database to a
             different file or database.  The problem is that in SQLite3 (though
             not in MySQL or PgSQL) the subquery ((SELECT DISTINCT guid FROM
             transactions)) (note the double parentheses) returns only the first
             guid in the subquery's results.  Some transactions are loaded by
             special queries and those queries are also used to retrieve the
             transaction's slots so they weren't affected.
    Bug 796398 - Restrict accelerator keys to valid date range.
    Bug 796409 - Incorrect Current Value for Stocks.
             Missed calculating the value in the register summary bar.
    Bug 796423 - Cannot Input Chinese, seems does not work with other IME too.
             Toggles not in view with all rows selected weren't being redrawn.
    Bug 796484 - csv import: iostream error
             Unfortunately it turns out that we can't use filestreams because
             they can't take path arguments containing Unicode on Windows.
    Bug 796527 - invalid currency on scheduled transactions.
             * Don't even check for price/exchange rate on template
               transactions, there's no point.
             * Check all split commodities are valid, abort transaction
               creation if not.
             * If the template transaction's currency isn't used by any of the
               splits set the new transaction's currency to the first-found
               currency if there is one, otherwise to the first-found commodity.
    Bug 796537 - Transaction Report cannot sort by "num".
    Bug 796586 - QIF import incorrectly converts unicode characters from UTF8
        encoded file.
    Bug 796595 - QIF Import Select Account button to add a new account is
        labeled gnc-account-new but should be New.
    Bug 796600 - stock split cash-in-lieu income/asset labels backwards.
    Bug 796614 - Reconciliation report contains incorrect transactions.
    Bug 796638 - configuration not properly saved for CSV transactions import
        form.


Other repairs or enhancements not marked as bugs:
    Transaction report improvements:
      * Performance: Do all filtering ops before sorting.
      * Move the options summary before the subtotals table.
      * New unit tests
      * Enable computing averages in subtotal grid.
      * Generate the subtotal grid only if the primary sort key enables
        subtotals.
      * Fix subtotal grid to support multiple commodities.
      * New filters.
      * Much cleaning and refactoring of the internals.
    Cache the num-split-action book option to avoid thousands of KVP queries
      for the same value when loading a register.
    Create a static string for book option KVPs to save an extra malloc/free
      on old compilers without small-string optimization.
    Add tooltip support for register cells.
    New unit tests for the balance sheet report and invoices.
    Consolidate charting code into a single module.
    Removed an incomplete and abandoned C implementation of QIF import.
    Restored libsecret support that had been left out of CMake.
    Replace old-style html style attributes with css.
    Modify emitted html to be parsable by the Guile SXML module for testing.
    Remove support for long-gone gtkhtml renderer.
    Clean up code generating html tables.
    Ensure full precision of doubles is saved to SQL.
      std::iostream's operator<<(double) uses only 6 digits of precision by
      default.
    Make float database operations more consistent, working around dbd-sqlite3's
      failure to support doubles (dbd-sqlite3, not sqlite3 itself).
    Prevent crash in gnc-tree-view.c: When getting information from the state
      file, protect against the key not having a '_' which is used to split the
      string.
    Add the full account name to the saved register settings
      If you need to delete the layout for a register in the settings file,
      the only thing identifying it is the account guid. To make it easier
      for humans, add the full account name also.
    When register pages are restored it uses the full account name.
      When register pages are restored, the account is found from the full
      name so if the separator changes it will fail. Instead, also save the
      account guid and use that as default to find the account falling back
      to the full name.
    Fix misplaced try block that caused unhandled exception if year out of
      range.
    Fix permanent storage of vendor details: Since the data types did not match
      for the billterms and taxtable, those references/guids were not saved to
      the database.
    Update invoice reports to use totals calculate by gncInvoice. This should
      give a consistent representation of invoice data across the application.
    Ensure gncEntry rounding is consistent. Internally calculated values in the
      entry are never rounded. Consumers of gncEntry's calculated values can
      request them either rounded or not. Next use a pragmatic approach for
      calculating values on invoices based on the entry values: do the rounding
      such that we never create an unbalanced transaction while posting.
      That means:
      * round each entry's net value before summing them in net total
      * accumulate all tax totals on invoice level per tax account before
        rounding
      and round before before summing them in a global tax total
      Hopefully this will catch a few more rounding issues in this area.
      A complete solution can only offered if we allow users to manually correct
      tax entries. This requires changes to user interface and data format so
      that's not going to happen in gnucash 3.x.
    Use Scheme SRFI-64 test framework for new Scheme unit tests.
    New compilers (gcc-8.0 and Xcode 9) bring new warnings, so several fixups to
      mollify them.
    Lowercase all cmake commands for better readability.
    Metadata migration (2.6.x->3.x) fixes for Windows.
    Ensure timezone is set correctly in FreeBSD.

3.1 - 29 April 2018
The second release of the 3.x stable series.

The following bugs have been fixed:
    Bug 118391 - Long currency names untranslated
    Bug 769686 - Notes not imported when using update and reconcile in
                 import transactions from CSV
    Bug 772776 - VERY large queries (over 11000 fields in IN clause) slow
                 down GnuCash
    Bug 782144 - git-master - Save Corrupts Data File / Not Open Data File
    Bug 792105 - Startup takes several minutes
    Bug 793461 - Transaction matcher window blank when importing QFX
    Bug 794767 - Dates default to 01/01/1970
    Bug 794916 - Fails to find environment file at startup when installation
                 prefix is '/opt'
    Bug 794936 - 3.0 does not open previously saved sqlite3 files properly
                 - corrupted business data
    Bug 794941 - Both print icons export to pdf
    Bug 794953 - Ellipsize on short tab labels
                 Correct error on when to ellipsize tab labels. Also as this
                 is used in two places separate out this to new function so
                 it is not duplicated.
    Bug 794990 - Double click does not work on saved reports
                 When you double click on the saved report description nothing
                 happens. This was down to a conflict on a couple of call
                 backs and one of them was incorrectly setup.
    Bug 794994 - Display Alphavantage key in full
                 Set the entry to expand so all the space is used to display.
    Bug 795031 - 3.0 Crashes on loading when opening 2.6.19 file
    Bug 795039 - Crash on startup using Technicolor Style sheet in report
    Bug 795040 - GnuCash crashes when searching for a newly created bill
    Bug 795049 - GnuCash 2.6.20-1 (Fedora Linux package) is unable to open
                 MariaDB.
    Bug 795064 - Enable subtotal-only if either sortkeys are dates
                 This will allow 'show subtotals only' if sortkeys are
                 date-types. This allows, for example, prime-sortkey=date,
                 yearly. sec-sortkey=date, monthly.
    Bug 795068 - src/optional/python-bindings missing several files
    Bug 795080 - Some dates reset to 01/01/1970
                 An odd corner case: BST apparently came off of DST at 23:00
                 26 Oct 2014, so midnight that day was ambiguous about being
                 DST or not; that causes the local_date_time constructor to
                 throw in spite of the tm.is_dst element being 0 (meaning pick
                 standard time). Instead of just failing in that case, try
                 constructing a local_date_time three hours later then adjust
                 it back three hours. If *that* doesn't work then throw a
                 std::invalid argument.
    Bug 795082 - CSV import crashes if a transaction's 'Account' field is
                 empty and no default Account set
    Bug 795101 - Scrollbar floats and covers toggle buttons
                 When the scrollbar appears for the reconcile windows it can
                 float above the reconcile toggle button which make it
                 difficult to toggle. Move this column to the start which has
                 the advantage of aligning the amount column above the Total
                 value.
    Bug 795142 - Unable to enter account codes in business sheets
                 In Bills, Invoices and Expense vouchers you can not enter an
                 account code in an account field like you can on a normal
                 register, enable this.
    Bug 795155 - CSV import does not distinguish between deposit and withdrawal
    Bug 795347 - Australian (GMT+10) OFX transactions imported have previous
                 days date
    Bug 795377 - Reads and saves Gnucash 2.6.19 XML file, then can't reread
                 it, due to bad date in old file
    Bug 795389 - Hard to see figures in the budget window
                 The budget view had hard coded black for normal values and
                 dark grey for other values. Changed this so normal values
                 are reset to default color and adjusted the grey based on
                 default color for theme.
    Bug 795405 - All Dates in Price Database Off-By-One After 3.0 Upgrade
    Bug 795446 - On Windows there is a blank tip of the day
                 When the tip_of_the_day.list is created a new line is
                 appended to the list file and on Windows this causes a blank
                 tip so remove the adding of the extra line.
    Bug 795471 - Budget window scrolls edited cell out of site
                  When editing cells that have been revealed on the right by
                  scrolling the window snaps back to the left hiding the cell
                  being edited. This may be due to an underlying gtk issue
                  but these changes fix the issue visually.

Other repairs or enhancements not marked as bugs:
    On Windows the tooltip for saved reports was incorrect
        When the mouse was placed over a saved report description on Windows an
        empty tooltip was displayed. Setup the query tooltip callback so it does
        not display a tooltip for description column.
    Fix crash when loading sql book with posted transactions
    Add ability to recognize and use a pre-compiled libgmock.so.
    html-font: add default font family
        Windows ships with GTK2 in which the default font styles are named
        "Sans" "Sans Bold" "Sans Normal" etc. There is no "Sans" font in
        Windows; I vote to add a default "Sans-Serif" font-family which is
        valid CSS. This ensures exported reports are shown as intended.
    Several improvements to the Transaction and GST reports.
    csv-import - Allow empty amount fields
        Treat empty amount fields as 0. This is necessary for example in
        the case the csv import file has both a deposit and a withdrawal
        column.
    Remove the set transient parent setting for Reconcile window
        The Reconcile option is already a window so it is not necessary to set
        this value which allows the jump to transaction to work properly.
    Date Format dialog flashes up when file/properties used
        When you select the File/Properties dialog, in the construction of that
        a 'Date Format' dialog flashes up while the date component is moved to
        the properties dialog. Can mainly be seen on Windows so remove the
        visible setting in glade file.
    Prevent throw in gnc-pricedb.
        If a price lookup is given an invalid time64/timespec (i.e. INT64_MAX)
        then just return NULL instead of trying to find the nearest price.
    Set GNC_VCS at build time instead of when making the tarball.
        Because the tarball is always made from a VCS repo.
    If there are no prices in the db, critical errors are flagged
        When dialog transfer is used between two commodities and there are no
        prices in the db a critical error is logged. Test for price object
        being NULL before retrieving the price for the error message.

3.0 - 1 April 2018
The first release of the 3.x stable series.
New Features for Users:
    The headline item for this release is that GnuCash now uses the
        Gtk+-3.0 Toolkit and the WebKit2Gtk API. This change was forced
        on us by some major Linux distributions dropping support for
        the WebKit1 API. Unfortunately the Webkit project doesn't
        support Microsoft Windows so that platform will continue to use
        the WebKit1 API, though with Gtk3. We've selected Gtk+-3.14.0
        as the minimum version because it fully supports CSS
        theming.
    New editors to remove outdated or incorrect match data from the
        import maps, a new user interfaces for managing files associated with
        transactions, an improved facility for removing old prices from the
        price database, and a way to remove deleted files from the history
        list in the file menu.
    New Reports: A Reconciliation Report based on the Transaction Report,a
        Income GST Report, and a Cashflow Barchart report.
    A new CSV importer largely rewritten in C++, adding new
        features including the ability to re-import CSV files exported
        from GnuCash, along with a separate CSV price importer.
    A new preference panel for the Alphavantage API key so that Finance::Quote
       users need not edit /etc/gnucash/environment. We've removed all
       references to the various Yahoo! quote sources and made Alphavantage
       the default.
    Data file directories are now located appropriately to the
        operating system's conventions by default:
        - Windows: CSIDL_APPDATA/Gnucash
        - OS X: $HOME/Application Support/Gnucash
        - Linux: $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gnucash (or the default $HOME/.config/gnucash)
         It's still possible to override with the environment variable
         GNC_DOC_PATH, which replaces GNC_DOT_DIR in earlier versions of
         GnuCash.
    Accounts in the Bayes import map are now linked by GUID instead
        of names so that the matcher won't have to be retrained if you
        rename an account.  The Bayesian import maps are also stored in a
        flatter structure to allow faster access, especially in SQL. These
        changes mean that if you have Bayesian mapping data, once converted
        your database will be loadable only by GnuCash 2.6.20 and later.
    MySQL and SQLite3 date storage has changed a bit. Once converted, MySQL
        and SQLite3 database will be loadable only by GnuCash 2.6.19 and later.
    Numerics are rewritten to allow for more significant digits. The old
        6-digit-maximum fraction is now 9-digits, and prices may have up
        to 18 digit precision.
    Chart Reports appearance is improved, including more modern chart colors
        as suggested by https://clrs.cc/.
    Transaction Report improvements, including regular expression filtering
        and many more options and features including a "Subtotal Summary Grid"
        The subtotal summary-grid will tabulate subtotals - prime-sortkey
        vertically, sec-sortkey horizontally. For example, with
        prime-sortkey = accounts, sec-sortkey = date, sec-subtotal = monthly
        will produce a monthly time series table.
    The About dialog box layout is improved and now includes the detected
        Finance::Quote version.
    GnuCash will always build the locale-specific tax modules. This
        was optional when building with autotools and never enabled when
        building with cmake. Note that the only supported tax locales are
        en_US and de_DE.
    On Macs the Reconcile Window's menu moved to the menubar.
    GnuCash no longer supports Guile-1.8 and now does support Guile-2.2


New Features for Developers:
    Several parts of the engine and the SQL backend are rewritten
        in C++, an effort that will continue in the next development
        cycle. KVP is now private to libgncmod-engine and accessible
        outside via qof_instance_set and qof_instance_get. KVP and GUID are
        reimplemented in C++ using boost::variant and boost::UUID respectively.
    C++ unit tests require GoogleTest. While it's possible to use prebuilt
        libgtest and libgmock on some distros, building static libraries for
        GnuCash is preferred. It may be necessary to provide the paths to
        the googletest and googlemock source with CMake parameters
        GTEST_ROOT and GMOCK_ROOT respectively.
    The date implementation is migrated to boost::date-time,
        replacing a Glib GDateTime implementation. This makes the
        earliest date recordable 1 January 1400CE instead of 1 January 1CE.
        We doubt any users will be affected.
    Distribution tarballs can now be built with CMake as well as
        Autotools. (Rob Gowin)
    We've reorganized the code into a core library directory, libgnucash, and
        application-specific directory, gnucash. The python bindings are now
        in a top-level directory, bindings; code pinched from other projects
        is in borrowed, the account templates, check templates, and pixmaps
        are consolidated in data, and common holds the cmake modules and test
        framework code. The bin directory's contents have moved to the top
        level gnucash directory and bin is removed.
        There are now directories for gschema, gtkbuilder and ui files directly
        in gnucash. In principle all files of each type should go into these
        global directories. The only exception is if such a file belongs
        to an optional module. In that case the file remains located inside
        that module's directory. Currently we have ui, glade and gschema file
        exceptions in aqb and ofx importers.
    The build system is changed from Autotools to CMake. All options except
        python bindings and the python console demo are enabled by default.
        Highly parallel builds with Ninja are possible and recommended,
        except on Microsoft Windows.
    The Windows build system is rewritten to use MSYS2, Mingw-w64, Powershell,
       and jhbuild.
    Add a "pot" target to the build system so that translators can easily
       generate a new gnucash.pot from a git repository.
    Detect presence or absence of libxml2 and makeinfo during configuration;
        abort if the first is missing and don't build the (mostly
        obsolete) texinfo documentation if the latter is. Document
        both in README.dependencies.
    Replaced Timespec with time64 in the Scheme and Python bindings,
       introducing many new C time64 functions to accommodate the
       replacement. Timespec will eventually be removed from the C API
       as well.
    Some cruft removal in libgnucash/scm plus moving some code to its
        only use location. "main.scm" is renamed to "utilities.scm".
    The "printf" family of Scheme custom functions is replaced with
        the built-in "format" facility.
    Change a generally unnecessary warning about being unable to open
        a module (usually because the file is still being created) to a
        debug message. It appears mostly during highly parallel builds and
        was distracting.
    Appstream configuration is updated to the latest spec.
    Added two functions to the Scheme option API:
        * gnc:option-make-internal! will hide an existing option. e.g. a
          derived report can set the value for a Display/* option and hide
          it from the user.
        * gnc:unregister-option will unregister option. This is primarily
          useful for derived options e.g. another report copies from
          transaction.scm and removes some options and recreates them with
          different parameters.
        For example, unregister existing option from section "Accounts"
        name "Accounts", and recreate with different parameters
        e.g. limited account types.
    Drop intltool in favour or using modern gettext.
        By default we require gettext 0.19.6 as this is needed to generate a
        translated version of gnucash.desktop and gnucash.appdata.xml.
        For platforms where this isn't available, setting ALLOW_OLD_GETTEXT=ON
        will allow building but some strings will not be extracted to
        gnucash.pot
    Pass GTEST_ROOT and GMOCK_ROOT through to distcheck.
        So that they don't have to be exported in the environment if they're
        needed.
    The Python Bindings and Console are now for Python 3, and enhanced to
        expose more GnuCash API.
        Compilation of GLib Schemas during build and installation can be
        disabled by setting -DCOMPILE_GSCHEMAS=OFF. This is intended
        *only* for distribution packaging scripts that run
        glib-compile-schemas themselves. Otherwise note that if you install
        to a DESTDIR you'll need to re-run glib-compile-scemas after moving
        the contents of $DESTDIR$PREFIX/share/glib-2.0/schemas to $PREFIX.
    The CuteCash front end has been removed. The code we need from
        GOffice has been brought into the GnuCash code base so GOffice
        is no longer a dependency. The register drawing code has been
        upgraded to draw directly on a cairo surface, removing the dependency
        on libgnomecanvas.
    GnuCash 3.0 adds the following dependencies: Boost, ICU, Googletest.

Known Problems:
    It is not possible to overwrite SQL Databases from within GnuCash, even
        though GnuCash will ask if you want to. Bug 789594
    There is no theming tool for Windows or Macs so users of those platforms
        must apply theming by hand. Bug 791823
    Accounting Period dates are subject to change with time zone and
        daylight-time changes. Bug 791825
    Opening a large SQL database on Windows is very slow on some machines,
        merely slow on others. Bugs 792105, 794482.
    Some HBCI information is not loaded correctly so the first transaction
        download will re-retrieve transactions unless the beginning date is
        set explicitly. Bug 792397.
    The new CSV importer's Price of Shares column doesn't work. Bug 793306
    Importing an OFX file on Windows fails with an empty matcher window.
        Bug 793461.
    The Bayes account matcher can take a long time to convert the accounts
        from name string to guids. This is a one-off, happening only the
        first time one imports into an account on GnuCash 3.0. Bug 794334.
    The new CSV importer's numeric parser can't parse numbers of the form
        x + y/z. Bug 793556.
    Python bindings may not work in some installations because the bindings
        are unable to find the backend modules (libgncmod-backend-dbi and
        libgncmod-backend-xml). Bug 794526
    Get Quotes can be slow if one has a large number of saved prices.
        Bug 794644.
    Some users see 1 January 1970 instead of the default date in the New
        Invoice or New Bill dialog and on the unposted bill and invoice.
        Bug 794767.
    The Mac localization code can set the wrong encoding for strftime causing
        the register's date picker to label months "Null" in some locales.
        Bug 794807
    On Mac, the File Open dialog will crash if one types anything. Bug 794809
    An open register is not immediately updated when the Since Last Run
        dialog creates transaction splits in the register's account. Bug 794854
    GnuCash asks if one wants to save changes when quitting or opening a file
        even if there's no book open. Bug 794870
    The Online Actions menu includes some obsolete and non-functional
        selections. Bug 794880.

2.6.20 - 1 April 2018
This is the final release in the 2.6 stable series.
The following bugs are fixed:
    Bug 765846 - Expense Over Time for subaccounts: An error occurred while
                 running the report: Fix crash if acc-depth too low.
    Bug 791848 - GC 2.6.x does not handle ISO dates introduced with GC 2.7
                 Enable reading ISO-formatted dates, recognize
                 GNC_FEATURE_SQLITE3_ISO_DATES.
    Bug 792008 - gnucash 2.6.19 fails to build
                 Replace g_assert_true with g_assert for now
    Bug 793278 - wrong data in charts with accumulated values (like
                 "net-linechart", "net-barchart" and "liabilities barchart")
    Bug 794030 - relative date functions compute wrong day of month
    Bug 790526 - Mathematical bug
                 This change will fix 'num-of-weeks-since-1/jan/1970' which
                 formerly used quotient to remove the fractional part of the
                 division. For negative values of num-of-weeks, the number is
                 truncated in the wrong direction (i.e. towards 0). This
                 change uses floor instead to ensure the num-of-weeks found
                 is the nearest integer LESS than the fractional number.

Other repairs or enhancements not marked as bugs:
    Online HBCI actions: Remove outdated non-SEPA menu items.
    Add XML namespaces for all Account Hierarchy Templates.
    General cleanup of Account Hierarchy Templates.
    Fix auto-selection of splits in reconcile
        Really use all splits of any given day. Up to now usually the splits
        of the given date were not or not all included, as the time comparison
        didn't correctly ignore any given time-of-day of the splits. Instead,
        all possible time-of-days should be included.
    Properly detect git in case of linked worktree
    Account Hierarchy for India: Set LANGUAGE=hi and LANG=en_IN to access it.
    Improve Import menu entries Customer & vendors...
        use same menu label as others, replace template by tooltip, add ellipsis
        to entry, add comments to distinguish "Import" as verb and substantive.
    Provide preference panel to set the Alpha Vantage API key needed for
        Finance::Quote.
    Correct the appstream definition to match the current spec.
    Fix collectors and min-date handling in reports.

2.7.8 - 25 March 2018

    The Gnucash Development Team is pleased to release Gnucash 2.7.8,
    the ninth release of an unstable series leading to Gnucash 3.0. This
    release is a Release Candidate: If no bugs requiring major work are
    reported the next release will be 3.0.

    This release changes file locations, binding APIs, report options,
    and can make your data file no longer compatible with previous
    versions. See https://wiki.gnucash.org/wiki/UpdateNotes for
    details.

The following bugs are fixed only in unstable/master:
    Bug 787439 - Segmentation Fault in Transfer dialog after clearing
                 Date field and pressing escape.
    Bug 794242 - Remove keep above setting for assistant hierarchy

Other repairs not marked as bugs in git:
    When doing a file save from the a new start we have no key file
        Test for Key_file not being NULL before trying to free it.
    Stop critical error due to testing null filename
       g_filename_from_uri returns NULL if it is not a file uri so test
       for the file:// prefix before doing g_file_test
    More transient-parent fixes.
    Add missing response section to the account picker dialog.
    Glade 3.20 adds surplus padding option to action area
        When glade files are saved which have GtkAssistants defined a packing
        section is added to the assistant action area which then causes a
        warning so remove them.
    Add XML namespaces for all Account Hierarchy Templates.
    Increase default options dialog size: The old 400x400 was woefully
        inadequate for most options especially options involving account trees.

Updated Translations: None.

2.7.7 - 18 March 2018

    The Gnucash Development Team is pleased to release Gnucash 2.7.7,
    the eighth release of an unstable series leading to Gnucash 3.0.

    Notice that we've decided that beginning with the upcoming major
    release we will use two-digit release numbers and that the next
    stable release will be 3.0. Maintenance releases will be 3.1, 3.2,
    etc. The next unstable release will be 3.900 and will lead to 4.0.

    This release is UNSTABLE and SHOULD NOT BE USED in production.
    See the KNOWN PROBLEMS list at the bottom of the announcement.

    This release changes file locations, binding APIs, report options,
    and can make your data file no longer compatible with previous
    versions. See https://wiki.gnucash.org/wiki/UpdateNotes for
    details.

New Features For Users:

For Developers and Distro packagers:
    The Python Bindings and Console are now for Python 3.
    It's now possible to create a GncPrice from the Python bindings
        with "gnc_price_create(book)", removing the need to clone an existing
        GncPrice object and modify it.
    Compilation of GLib Schemas during build and installation can be
        disabled by setting -DCOMPILE_GSCHEMAS=OFF. This is intended
        *only* for distribution packaging scripts that run
        glib-compile-schemas themselves.

The following bugs are fixed only in unstable/master:
    Bug 787439 - Segmentation Fault in Transfer dialog after clearing
                 Date field and pressing escape.
    Bug 791831 - Add python3 support.
    Bug 794242 - Remove keep above setting for assistant hierarchy

Other repairs not marked as bugs in git:
    Fix date corruption in SQL load. Four date elements were affected:
        GncEntry::date, GncEntry::date_entered, GncInvoice::opened, and
        GncInvoice::posted. This does not affect the stored values of the dates.
    Fix lost Bayesian matches in SQL backend. The import-map-bayes uses a
        three-part key that uses the same delimiter as a path and the SQL
        backend was throwing away everything except the account guid.
    More transient-window fixes and other Gtk3 cleanups.
    Add xmlns namespace declarations to all of the accounts templates that
        lacked it and remove the emacs mode-setting comments at the end of them.

Updated Translations: Spanish

2.7.6 - 12 March 2018

    The Gnucash Development Team is pleased to release Gnucash 2.7.6,
    the seventh release of an unstable series leading to Gnucash 3.0.

    Notice that we've decided that beginning with the upcoming major
    release we will use two-digit release numbers and that the next
    stable release will be 3.0. Maintenance releases will be 3.1, 3.2,
    etc. The next unstable release will be 3.900 and will lead to 4.0.

    This release is UNSTABLE and SHOULD NOT BE USED in production.
    See the KNOWN PROBLEMS list at the bottom of the announcement.

    This release changes file locations, binding APIs, report options,
    and can make your data file no longer compatible with previous
    versions. See https://wiki.gnucash.org/wiki/UpdateNotes for
    details.

New Features For Users:
    Modernize chart colors from the dated CSS defaults to
        modern colors as suggested by https://clrs.cc/.
    Add "Subtotal Summary Grid" to the Transaction Report.
        The subtotal summary-grid will tabulate subtotals - prime-sortkey
        vertically, sec-sortkey horizontally. This will be useful, for
        example, with prime-sortkey = accounts, sec-sortkey = date,
        sec-subtotal = monthly... will produce a monthly time series
        spreadsheet.

For Developers and Distro packagers:
    Rework source directory structure for gschema, gtkbuilder and ui files.
        There is now a directory for each respective file type directly in
        <srcdir>/gnucash as was already the case for gschema files.
        In principle all files of each type should go into these global
        directories. The only exception is if such a file belongs
        to an optional module. In that case the file remains located inside
        that module's directory. Currently we have ui, glade and gschema file
        exceptions in aqb and ofx importers.
    Drop intltool in favour or using modern gettext.
        By default we require gettext 0.19.6 as this is needed to generate a
        translated version of gnucash.desktop and gnucash.appdata.xml.
        For platforms where this isn't available, setting ALLOW_OLD_GETTEXT=ON
        will allow building but some strings will not be extracted to
        gnucash.pot
    Pass GTEST_ROOT and GMOCK_ROOT through to distcheck.
        So that they don't have to be exported in the environment if they're
        needed.
The following bugs are fixed only in unstable/master:
    Bug 764245 - multi-column reports include incorrect sub-reports
    Bug 793460 - gnucash/import-export/csv-imp/assistant-csv-trans-import.cpp:1941

    Bug 793467 - GnuCash crashes when trying to open a binary file
                 instead of a CSV.

                 Don't test before 1916, that's not a common GnuCash use-case.
    Bug 793947 - Impossible to render printable invoice
    Bug 794031 - The checkbox "Placeholder" can't be changed in dialog
                 "Setup selected accounts". Enable placeholder toggle and
                 provide callback. The text for this account tree view
                 specifies "If you would like an account to be a placeholder
                  account, click the checkbox for that account." but they were
                  not enabled and no call back was defined so enabled the
                  toggle button and provide callback.
    Bug 794083 - gnucash-2.7.5: cmake+make build installs Makefile.
    Bug 794137 - 2.7.5: test failure: 60 - test-gnc-numeric.
                 Fixed by overloading operator<<(std::ostream&, GncNumeric) to
                 call operator<<(std::wostream&, GncNumeric) and convert the
                 result to utf8.
Other repairs not marked as bugs in git:
    Csv imp settings - internalize prefix handling
        This information is not relevant outside of the settings code.
        The way it's implemented now each settings module defines its
        own unique prefix and the generic code can just use it when
        needed.
    Csv import - improve memory handling in the assistant class.
        Make it more RAII, in that whatever the class allocates, it should
        also deallocate. This simplifies a couple of memory handling cases.
        The only exception is the generic import matcher that for some reason
        has chosen to deallocate itself. To be fixed when more importers are
        converted to c++
    Add some background info on memory management in CSV importers.
        As the assistant code combines multiple memory management models care
        should be taken not to mix them up. The notes should give some
        insights in how to do this.
        Also fix a few minor issues
        - delete default copy and move constructor/assignment for the
          assistant gui class
        - nullify a freed pointer
    Lots of transient parent warnings fixed.
    Fix Segmentation fault when going to File->New.
        When selecting the File->New with existing register pages open a crash
        can happen as the register pages get closed forcing a page-changed
        signal to queue the page focus function when there is no page. Add a
        call to remove the page focus function in the ..destroy_widget function.
        Also with the addition of g_idle_remove before the add when page-changed
        is emitted the page focus function only gets run once.
    Speed up GUID equality comparison.
    Fix CPack package version number.
        Currently running "ninja-build package" produces a file with an
        incorrect version number. This patch passes the CMake version
        variables into CPack to get the correct filename. Note, however, that
        there's more work to do to get CPack to actually be useful and the
        current CPack settings may be removed unless that other work is done.
    Add spacing between border and text in dialog "New Accounts Hierarchy
        Setup".
    With register obscured the sheet kept being redrawn
        When the register is obscured by another window, the sheet would get
        lot of draw events. This was tracked down to getting the foreground
        color for the item-edit widget for the state GTK_STATE_FLAG_NORMAL.
        Changed this to use the value obtained from gtk_widget_get_state_flags.
    Use the gnc_prefs_get_bool values to update cache values.
        This way is a safer way to update the cache values in case the settings
        changed signal fails to trigger or there is a double trigger and the
        cached value gets out of sync with the preference value.

2.7.5 - 25 February 2018

    The Gnucash Development Team is pleased to release Gnucash 2.7.5,
    the sixth release of an unstable series leading to Gnucash 3.0.

    Notice that we've decided that beginning with the upcoming major
    release we will use two-digit release numbers and that the next
    stable release will be 3.0. Maintenance releases will be 3.1, 3.2,
    etc. The next unstable release will be 3.900 and will lead to 4.0.

    This release is UNSTABLE and SHOULD NOT BE USED in production.
    See the KNOWN PROBLEMS list at the bottom of the announcement.

    This release changes file locations, binding APIs, report options,
    and can make your data file no longer compatible with previous
    versions. See https://wiki.gnucash.org/wiki/UpdateNotes for
    details.

New Features For Users:

    Locate all user data and configuration files to platform-dependent
    standard locations:
    - Windows: CSIDL_APPDATA/Gnucash
    - OS X: $HOME/Application Support/Gnucash
    - Linux: $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gnucash (or the default $HOME/.config/gnucash)

    Further improvements to the Transaction and Income-GST-statement reports.

    Transaction Report: omit display of $0 in subtotals in other currencies.
    Previously in dual-subtotal columns, the dual-subtotal would
    attempt to print all commodities in the row. This meant if user
    chose common-currency thereby triggering additional commodities,
    the dual-subtotal would attempt to add amounts in other
    commodities which would be 0, and display the 0 amount.

For Developers and Distro packagers:

    Some cruft removal in libgnucash/scm plus moving some code to its
    only use location. "main.scm" is renamed to "utilities.scm".

    The "printf" family of Scheme custom functions is replaced with
    the built-in "format" facility.

    Change a generally unnecessary warning about being unable to open
    a module (usually because the file is still being created) to a
    debug message. It appears mostly during highly parallel builds and
    was distracting.

    Added dependency information to all CMake targets, replacing a
    dependency on build order that was carried over from
    autotools. Highly parallel builds in ninja now complete without
    interruption.

    Ensure that all GtkBuilder and GtkUIManager files are correctly
    installed and that no configuration of build products in those
    directories are..

    Appstream configuration is updated to the latest spec.

    Fix installation of a gnucash-only gschemas.compiled overwriting
    the system one. Note that if you install to a DESTDIR you'll need
    to re-run glib-compile-scemas after moving the contents of
    $DESTDIR$PREFIX/share/glib-2.0/schemas to $PREFIX.

    Added two functions to the Scheme option API:
    * gnc:option-make-internal! will hide an existing option. e.g.  a
      derived report can set the value for a Display/* option and hide
      it from the user.
    * gnc:unregister-option will unregister option. This is primarily
      useful for derived options e.g. another report copies from
      transaction.scm and removes some options and recreates them with
      different parameters.
    For example, unregister existing option from section "Accounts"
    name "Accounts", and recreate with different parameters
    e.g. limited account types.

The following bugs are fixed only in unstable/master:
    Bug 787095 - Gnucash Crashes when opening old XML file.
    Bug 792157 - Cannot create account with different currency
    Bug 792833 - User specifies source of 'num' field'; either transaction
                 number or split action (requires at least GnuCash
                 2.5.0) Strip leading delimiters from KVP keys when
                 reading them from the database. Leading delimiters
                 are incorrectly included in databases created with
                 GnuCash 2.6.x.
    Bug 792883 - cmake: no way to turn off -Werror
                 Prepend settings to CMAKE_C_FLAGS and CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS
                 so that values supplied on the command line can
                 override the fixed settings.

    Bug 792884 - cmake: gschemas.compiled missing
    Bug 793122 - 2.7.3: ninja build fails.
    Bug 793155 - Gnucash 2.7.4 crashes on launch MacOS 10.13.4 PB1
    Bug 793278 - wrong data in charts with accumulated values (like
                 "net-linechart", "net-barchart" and "liabilities barchart")
    Bug 793568 - "Cash Flow" report crashes

Other repairs not marked as bugs in git:

    An optimization in the GncDateTime string constructor provides
    substantial speed up of loading SQL databases, and one in
    Scheduled Transaction creation will speed up creation of large
    numbers of scheduled transactions.

    More dialogs have transient-for set so that they pop up over the
    window instead of in the upper left-hand corner of the monitor.

Updated Translations: German, Greek, Slovak, Spanish

    A new set of business account templates for India's new GST; use
    locale en_IN to enable them.

New Features For Users:
    A greatly enhanced Transaction report with many new options and features
         including a reconciliation report thanks to Chris Lam.
    Removed 6-figure rounding from price calculations, allowing prices to
         have up to 18 digit precision.
     A flatter storage scheme for Bayes account-matching scores, thanks
           to Aaron Laws. This is a compatibility change guarded by a feature.
     GnuCash no longer supports Guile-1.8 and now does support Guile-2.2
     A CSV Price importer, thanks to Bob Fewell.
     Enhanced python bindings exposing more GnuCash API thanks to Guy Taylor

The following bugs are fixed only in unstable/master:
    Bug 616709 - Pressing delete key while editing account name offers to
         delete account.
    Bug 771667 - Change reconciled splits warning
         This patch displays two distinct warnings when changing
         protected fields of a transaction that contains reconciled
         splits. If the fields date, num and description are changed,
         then the warning list the accounts that have reconciled
         splits and also advises that they will be unreconciled after
         editing the transaction. If the fields account, transfer,
         debit or credit are changed then the warning advises that the
         split will be unreconciled after editing the transaction.
         There is still just one warning preference as it is all to do
         with fields protected by reconciliation.
    Bug 787497 - Disabling options cripples dist package PARTIAL FIX:
          WITH_OFX, WITH_SQL and WITH_AQBANKING handling is fixed. The
          dist files for these features are always included in the
          dist tarball.
    Bug 790526 - Mathematical bug
    Bug 791848 - GC 2.6.x does not handle ISO dates introduced with GC 2.7.
         Set a feature to prevent versions older that 2.6.20 from
         loading a database from which they cannot read the
         dates. Ideally we would do this only if the database is
         written to, but the current persistence design includes
         committing back to the database during the load so the net
         effect is that the flag would be set anyway.
         This is a compatibility change guarded by a feature.


Other repairs not marked as bugs in git:
    Tests now pass in all timezones.
    More dialogs are made "transient for" so that they pop up centered on
         the main Gnucash window instead of somewhere on the left edge of the
         screen.
    A lot of Gtk3 issues and errors are fixed, thanks to Bob Fewell.
    Test struct tm* returns from gnc_gmtime and gnc_localtime to ensure that
         we don't crash for dereffing a nullptr.
    Removed the gnc:numeric type from Scheme code in favor of Scheme's own
          rational numbers. This allows direct conversion between
          Scheme numbers and gnc_numeric without the performance or
          accuracy penalties arising from using doubles as an
          intermediary.
     Pass KVP paths as a collection of elements instead of a delimited string.
           This allows keys to contain '/'. Thanks to Aaron Laws.
     Added a framework for migrating preferences.
     Made separate functions for finding a widget's parent window:
          gnc_ui_get_gtk_window tries to find the immediate parent and
          gnc_ui_get_main_window tries to find the widget's parent
          toplevel, returning the first-mapped window.
     Make the splash/lock screen the transient parent for dialog boxes if the
          main window is not yet mapped.
     Rework directory determination in CMake builds.
          Sets paths for finding components depending on the state
          of ENABLE_BINRELOC, GNC_UNINSTALLED, GNC_BUILDDIR and
          whether any install paths have been set outside of
          CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.  GNUInstallDirs changes the name of
          CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR depending on the operating system and
          distro. When CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX is /usr, /usr/local, or
          any subdirectory of /opt it also changes
          CMAKE_INSTALL_FULL_SYSCONFDIR to /etc. An earlier commit by
          Aaron Laws mirrors the name of CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR to the
          build library directory.  It's possible for builders to set
          any of the install directories anywhere they please.
          Setting any directory outside of CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX breaks
          Binreloc so the toplevel CMakeLists.txt now detects that and
          disables Binreloc.  If Binreloc is enabled then all path
          queries use it to find paths. This works in the build
          directory because the gnucash executable and all of the test
          programs are in build_directory/bin and LIBDIR, DATADIR, and
          SYSCONFDIR can be found in the same root path.  If Binreloc
          is disabled then in order to build or run programs from the
          build directory one must set GNC_UNINSTALLED and set
          GNC_BUILDDIR to the absolute path of the build
          directory. When those are set GNC_BUILDDIR replaces
          CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX in all paths that are subdirectories of
          CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX; paths that are not in
          CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX are appended whole to
          GNC_BUILDDIR. This process is consistent between CMake and
          gnc_path_get_foo. GnuCash is unlikely to run from a DESTDIR
          without Binreloc.

KNOWN PROBLEMS:

    On Microsoft Windows starting the AQBanking Setup Wizard crashes GnuCash.

    Bug 789594 - Unable to overwrite sqlite3 database file
    Bug 791823 - There is no Gtk3 theme-setting tool for Windows.

2.7.4 - 3 February 2018

    The Gnucash Development Team is pleased to release Gnucash 2.7.4,

    Notice that we've decided that beginning with the upcoming major
    release we will use two-digit release numbers and that the next
    stable release will be 3.0. Maintenance releases will be 3.1, 3.2,
    etc. The next unstable release will be 3.900 and will lead to 4.0.

    This release changes file locations, binding APIs, report options,
    and can make your data file no longer compatible with previous
    versions. See https://wiki.gnucash.org/wiki/UpdateNotes for
    details.

New Features For Users:
    A new preference panel for the Alphavantage API key so that Finance::Quote
       users need not edit /etc/gnucash/environment.
    On Macs the Reconcile Window's menu moved to the menubar.
    The detected Finance::Quote version is displayed in the About box.
    Removed all references to the various Yahoo! quote sources and made
       Alphavantage the default.

For Developers and Distro packagers:
    The autotools build system has been removed.
    Add a "pot" target to the build system so that translators can easily
       generate a new gnucash.pot from a git repository.
    Improve handling of generated distributable files
    Fix make dist on a clean checkout
        cmake with unix makefiles fails to resolve dist dependencies
        added from COPY_FROM_BUILD if these dependencies aren't built
        yet. This commit replaces the COPY_FROM_BUILD based logic with
        two new functions 'dist_add_configured' and
        'dist_add_generated' to indicate which files should be
        included in the dist tarball. The latter also adds a target
        level dependency to the dist tarball custom command. Hence the
        former should be used for files that get generated during a
        cmake run while the latter should be used for files generated
        as the result of a 'make/ninja-build' run (like files for
        which an add_custom_command rule exists). Note: this commit
        also temporarily disables the dist target when building from a
        tarball (and hence it won't be tested in distcheck
        either). This will be handled in a future commit.
    Add DL_LIBS to gncmod-gnome-utils target. Fixes a build problem in FreeBSD.
    Detect presence or absence of libxml2 and makeinfo during configuration;
        abort if the first is missing and don't build the (mostly
        obsolete) texinfo documentation if the latter is. Document
        both in README.dependencies.
    Replaced Timespec with time64 in the Scheme and Python bindings,
       introducing many new C time64 functions to accommodate the
       replacement. Timespec will eventually be removed from the C API
       as well.

The following bugs are fixed only in unstable/master:
    Bug 787497 - Disabling OFX, AqBanking or python-bindings support cripples
                 the dist build target
    Bug 790526 - Mathematical bug
                 Actually about the number of weeks from/to 1 Jan 1970.
    Bug 790845 - 2.7.3: massive test failures on some architectures
    Bug 792106 - Wrong dates displayed
    Bug 792809 - Register text difficult to read with GTK 3.0 dark themes
                 Add a foreground css class to override the theme value.
    Bug 792947 - Missing translatable strings

Other repairs not marked as bugs in git:
    The long-standing known problem, AQBanking setup crashing on Windows.
    Webkit crashing the MacOS Gnucash.app.
    Some Guile 2.2 issues are resolved.
    Some bugs in the new Transaction Report.
    Correct setting of WebKit version during configuration when the version
       is cached.
    The change to the Average Cost calculation introduced in 2.6.12 is reverted.
       See the extensive discussion in Bug 775368 for mor information.
    Fix our appstream id as per the appstream recommendation
    Fix incorrect minimum dates in the net-linechart and net-barchart reports.
    Fix a report crash if the Account Depth is too low.

          Scheme numbers and gnc_numeric without the performance or
          accuracy penalties arising from using doubles as an
          intermediary.
     Pass KVP paths as a collection of elements instead of a delimited string.
           This allows keys to contain '/'. Thanks to Aaron Laws.
     Added a framework for migrating preferences.
     Made separate functions for finding a widget's parent window:
          gnc_ui_get_gtk_window tries to find the immediate parent and
          gnc_ui_get_main_window tries to find the widget's parent
          toplevel, returning the first-mapped window.
     Make the splash/lock screen the transient parent for dialog boxes if the
          main window is not yet mapped.
     Rework directory determination in CMake builds.
          Sets paths for finding components depending on the state
          of ENABLE_BINRELOC, GNC_UNINSTALLED, GNC_BUILDDIR and
          whether any install paths have been set outside of
          CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.  GNUInstallDirs changes the name of
          CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR depending on the operating system and
          distro. When CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX is /usr, /usr/local, or
          any subdirectory of /opt it also changes
          CMAKE_INSTALL_FULL_SYSCONFDIR to /etc. An earlier commit by
          Aaron Laws mirrors the name of CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR to the
          build library directory.  It's possible for builders to set
          any of the install directories anywhere they please.
          Setting any directory outside of CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX breaks
          Binreloc so the toplevel CMakeLists.txt now detects that and
          disables Binreloc.  If Binreloc is enabled then all path
          queries use it to find paths. This works in the build
          directory because the gnucash executable and all of the test
          programs are in build_directory/bin and LIBDIR, DATADIR, and
          SYSCONFDIR can be found in the same root path.  If Binreloc
          is disabled then in order to build or run programs from the
          build directory one must set GNC_UNINSTALLED and set
          GNC_BUILDDIR to the absolute path of the build
          directory. When those are set GNC_BUILDDIR replaces
          CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX in all paths that are subdirectories of
          CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX; paths that are not in
          CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX are appended whole to
          GNC_BUILDDIR. This process is consistent between CMake and
          gnc_path_get_foo. GnuCash is unlikely to run from a DESTDIR
          without Binreloc.

KNOWN PROBLEMS:

2.7.2 - 26 November 2017

    The Gnucash Development Team is pleased to release Gnucash 2.7.2,
    the third release of an unstable series leading to Gnucash 2.8.0.

    This release is UNSTABLE and SHOULD NOT BE USED in production.
    See the KNOWN PROBLEMS list at the bottom of the announcement.

    This release changes file locations, binding APIs, report options,
    and can make your data file no longer compatible with previous
    versions. See https://wiki.gnucash.org/wiki/UpdateNotes for
    details.

New Features For Users:
    No new features this time, but a raft of fixes and improvements!

The following bugs are fixed only in unstable/master:
    Bug 734865 - Assign as Payment... can silently 'unpay' a payed invoice
       * if the selected transaction is already linked to an existing
         payment, the payment dialog will present this payment again
         (same partner, post-to account, same selected document(s), same
         amount, memo, and transfer account).
       * if the selected transaction is not linked to an existing business
         transaction the logic will make a best guess as to whether the
         payment should be for a customer or vendor.
       * in both situations if the existing transaction has multiple splits
         that can be considered as transfer (or 'payment') splits the payment
         dialog can't work with it (it can only deal with one transfer split).
         In this case the user will be informed that only one valid transfer
         split will be retained and the others ignored.
       * the other thing the payment dialog can't handle are APAR type splits
         that are not associated to a lot at all. In case of transactions not
         part of a business transaction they will be silently ignored on the
         assumptions these were manually entered transactions with the
         intention to be linked to business transactions. On the other hand
         if such a split is part of a transaction that is also linked to a
         business payment already, a warning will be issued these splits will
         be removed from the new payment.
    Bug 778692 - Assign as payment should work for employee expense vouchers
       * if gnucash can deduce a partner from the transaction
         that partner will be proposed this works for all transactions
         that are part of a business transaction already and will
         correctly detect pre-existing customer, vendor and employee
         payments
       * if no partner can be deduced gnucash will assume the
         transaction to be a vendor or customer payment based on
         the sign
       * in all cases the user can change the partner type in the
         payment window that's presented to any of customer, vendor
         or employee to correct gnucash' suggestion.
    Bug 784623 - GNUCash does not work with sql backend.
        Wherein the problem is that MySQL's TIMESTAMP has a date range of
        1970-01-01 00:00:01 to 2038-01-19 03:14:07 and is unable to handle
        time_t of 0. MySQL's TIMESTAMP also assumes that input is in the
        server's timezone and adjusts it to UTC. GnuCash has already done
        that conversion.
    Bug 789608 - Compilation problems when linking libraries.
    Bug 789928 - FTBFS with libdbi 0.9.0-5 on Debian.
        This one required handling a new error condition.
    Bug 790550 - FTBFS: missing __init__.py


Other repairs not marked as bugs in git:

    SQL parameter quoting is corrected in the backend so that only string
    parameters are quoted. This caused trouble when trying to store SQL NULL;
    the string 'NULL' is different from the value NULL.

    SQL table versions weren't set consistently and a bogus version test could
    cause some tables to be not loaded.

    Better, more targeted handling of MySQL's penchant for setting
    date-time fields to "0000-00-00 00:00:00" if it doesn't like the
    input. This should be much less common thanks to fixing Bug
    784623.

    Major repairs to the "Dense Calendar" date selector.

    Fix colors on graph reports so that the selections work and the defaults
    are no longer transparent.

    Two large batches of styling fixes for Gtk3 from Bob Fewell.

    Fix the guile-compiled path in the environment file so that
    GnuCash can start on Windows.

    Convert the graphical reports to use GnuCash's rational numbers instead of
    doubles for better accuracy.


KNOWN PROBLEMS:

    On Microsoft Windows starting the AQBanking Setup Wizard crashes GnuCash.

    test-import-bayes built with autotools intermittently fails at
    line 381, where the returned value is 1 instead of the expected 6.

2.7.1 - 29 October 2017

    The Gnucash Development Team is pleased to release Gnucash 2.7.1,
    the second release of an unstable series leading to Gnucash 2.8.0.

    This release is UNSTABLE and SHOULD NOT BE USED in production.
    See the KNOWN PROBLEMS list at the bottom of the announcement.

New Features For Users:

A new Cashflow Barchart report from Jose Marino

    Transaction Report improvements, including regular expression filtering,
    from Christopher Lam.

    The About dialog box layout is improved.

    GnuCash will always build the locale-specific tax modules. This
    was optional when building with autotools and never enabled when
    building with cmake. Note that the only supported tax locales are
    en_US and de_DE.

The following bugs are fixed only in unstable/master:

    Bug 789298 - Prompt for file history update leads to crash during startup.

Other repairs not marked as bugs in git:

    GnuCash no longer crashes on startup on Windows.

    GnuCash no longer crashes when loading price data.

    The Options Dialogs will appear over the application window
    instead of wherever Gdk decides is coordinates 0, 0 on the
    display.

    Owners were not correctly linked to invoices in the SQL backend.

    Building from a tarball with python enabled now works.

    Fix Reconcile dialog always showing a 0 ending balance.

    Fix the book being always marked dirty at startup if it contained
    any scheduled transactions.

KNOWN PROBLEMS:

    On Microsoft Windows starting the AQBanking Setup Wizard crashes GnuCash.

    test-import-bayes built with autotools intermittently fails at
    line 381, where the returned value is 1 instead of the expected 6.

2.7.0 - 17 October 2017

    The Gnucash Development Team is pleased to release Gnucash 2.7.0,
    the first release of an unstable series leading to Gnucash 2.8.0.

    This release is UNSTABLE and SHOULD NOT BE USED in production.
    See the KNOWN PROBLEMS list at the bottom of the announcement.

    Note: Version information in the splash screen and About dialog
    will now reflect the date of the last commit used to build
    GnuCash rather than the date it was compiled. This is to assist
    quality assurance and debugging efforts by Linux distribution
    maintainers.

New Features For Users:

    The headline item for this release is that GnuCash now uses the
    Gtk+-3.0 Toolkit and the WebKit2Gtk API. This change was forced
    on us by some major Linux distributions dropping support for
    the WebKit1 API. Unfortunately the Webkit project doesn't
    support Microsoft Windows so that platform will continue to use
    the WebKit1 API, though with Gtk3. We've selected Gtk+-3.14.0
    as the minimum version because it fully supports CSS
    theming. (Geert Janssens and Robert Fewell)

    There's a new CSV importer largely rewritten in C++, adding new
    features including the ability to re-import CSV files exported
    from GnuCash. (Geert Janssens)

    Data file directories are now located appropriately to the
    operating system's conventions by default. It's still possible
    to override with the environment variable GNC_DOC_PATH, which
    replaces GNC_DOT_DIR in earlier versions of GnuCash. (Geert
    Janssens)

    Accounts in the Bayes import map are now linked by GUID instead
    of names so that the matcher won't have to be retrained if you
    rename an account. THIS WILL MAKE YOUR FILE UNREADABLE BY
    PREVIOUS VERSIONS OF GNUCASH. There's a new editor to remove
    outdated or incorrect match data from the import maps, a new
    user interfaces for managing files associated with transactions,
    an improved facility for removing old prices from the price
    database, and a way to remove deleted files from the history
    list in the file menu. (All from Robert Fewell!)

    Numerics are rewritten to allow for more significant
    digits. The old 6-digit-maximum fraction will be a 9-digit
    maximum by 2.8. there is still some cleanup required before the
    limit can actually change. (John Ralls)

    New Income GST Report and some improvements to the Transaction
    report. (Christopher Lam)

    Chart Reports appearance is improved (Carsten Rinke)

New Features For Developers

    Several parts of the engine and the SQL backend are rewritten
    in C++, an effort that will continue in the next development
    cycle. KVP is now private to libgncmod-engine and accessible
    outside via qof_instance_set and qof_instance_get. (John Ralls
    and Aaron Laws)

    KVP and GUID are reimplemented in C++ using boost::variant and
    boost::UUID respectively (Aaron Laws).

    The date implementation is migrated to boost::date-time,
    replacing a Glib GDateTime implementation. This makes the
    earliest date recordable 1 January 1400CE instead of 1 January
    1CE. We doubt any users will be affected. (John Ralls)

    Distribution tarballs can now be built with CMake as well as
    Autotools. (Rob Gowin)

    The CuteCash front end has been removed. The code we need from
    GOffice has been brought into the GnuCash code base so GOffice
    is no longer a dependency.

    Of interest mostly to developers, we've reorganized the code
    into a core library directory, libgnucash, and
    applications-specific directory, gnucash.

    A new Russian translation of the Guide has been started by
    Dmitriy Mandel. Downloads in the usual formats are available at
    https://code.gnucash.org/docs/ru/; the HTML is at
    https://code.gnucash.org/docs/ru/gnucash-guide/.

    There will be no unstable documentation release at this
    time. There have been very few relatively minor changes to the
    master documentation branch; those documents may be viewed in
    the nightly builds at https://www.gnucash.org/docs.phtml.

The following bugs are fixed only in unstable/master:
    Bug  87652 - KVP modification does not change 'dirty' flag.
    Bug 120250 - KVP XML loader ignores '0' timestamps?
    Bug 122895 - general ledger should be named journal
    Bug 343227 - Summary bar alignment patch.
    Bug 388500 - Add option to remove deleted files from the history list.
                 Allows removing files from the MRU list if they no longer exist.
    Bug 541541 - RFE: auto-hide unused accounts
    Bug 608098 - Option is hard to find: Change Transaction Report to show
                 account names in multirow txn

                 On the Transaction report the General->Style option
                 has been replaced with a similar Display->Detail Level
                 option. This was done in order to make the display of
                 some columns dependent on the value of this option.

                 When upgrading from 2.6.x or earlier to 2.8.x and you
                 had saved or open reports that had set General->Style
                 to 'Multi-line' you will have to update these reports
                 to set 'Multi-line' on the Display->Detail Level
                 option instead and optionally resave your report.
    Bug 639401 - Invoices Due Reminder
    Bug 645786 - Fancy invoice report still doesn't use fancy date format
                 preference
    Bug 647230 - Display the blank split after the "now" line instead of at the
                 end
    Bug 679791 - Import Template for importing CSV files - part2
    Bug 684719 - Man pages for gnc-fq-* perl scripts
    Bug 689489 - Be able to show file location
                 The file location is now visible in the status bar
                 while hovering over the recent file list of the File
                 menu. The currently open file is the top-most file in
                 this list so its location can be seen by hovering over
                 it with the mouse.

    Bug 756373 - Typos in Transaction Rpt options mouse-over text
    Bug 757532 - [PATCH] Make start and end rows editable by keyboard
    Bug 759674 - GNUCash crashes when importing invoices or bills with
                 delimited import
    Bug 760107 - Change default date completion to sliding window
                 The default date completion when entering partial
                 dates has been changed from "always complete in
                 current calendar year" to "complete to a sliding
                 window starting 11 months before current month". For
                 example if you enter "1/23" (January 23rd) while today
                 is December 10th 2015, the date will be expanded to
                 January 23rd 2016 rather than 2015. If you prefer to
                 keep the old behaviour, you can restore to it via
                 Edit->Preferences->Date/Time->Date Completion. In
                 addition if you were already using the sliding window
                 before, but didn't change the previous 6 months before
                 default, you will now also get the new default 11
                 months before. Again if you prefer the old behaviour
                 it can be restored via the same Preference.

Updated Translations: Farsi, German, Japanese, Latvian, Serbian, Spanish

2.6.17 - 2 July 2017

The following bugs are fixed:
      Bug 603379 - Prevent changing some Account Options if it has transactions
                   Followup: Relax the account type change restrictions again.
		   In the new implementation account types can'tz be changed
		   for an account with splits:
		   - if the change woud force a commodity change
		     (to/from normal accounts from/to stock related accounts)
		   - for immutable accounts
		   At the time of this commit the following account types are
		   considered immutable:
		   - Accounts Receivable
		   - Accounts Payable
		   - Trading accounts
      Bug 776396 - Foreign currency reports, amounts are not aligned correctly
                   Improve the styling of the table element used for foreign
		   currencies in the Balance sheet report so they end up
		   aligned with the other currencies.
      Bug 780845 - link in github repo README file needs correction/editing
      Bug 780889 - Split-register transactions result in invalid price:type
                   "transaction": Add 'transaction' to the schema and document
		   it in gnc-pricedb.h.
      Bug 781634 - Alert on missing account currency when opening account
      	  	   Also separate translatable commodity namespace strings
                   from those used in storage:
		   There is now a separate GNC_COMMODITY_NS_ISO_GUI
		   label to be used everywhere the user needs to read
		   'Currency namespace'. It's currently set to
		   'Currencies' and can be translated.

      Bug 782274 - Transactions produced by Transfer Funds or Process Payment
                   dialogs sort to beginning of day and do not honor NUM field
		   for custom sorting.
      Bug 782897 - Stock Split Assistant crashes GnuCash if you enter a New
                   Price and that already exists in the Price DB
      Bug 783095 - gnucash-2.6.16 segfaults on startup
      Bug 784317 - typo in 'import customers or vendors from text file' dialog

Other repairs not marked as bugs in git:
      Properly define the template namespace rather than using a local string
         everywhere
      Correctly store time64 0 in the SQL backend: The SQL backend ignored
         time64 0 when saving dates. time64 is a perfectly valid timestamp
	 (1970-01-01 00:00:00) and should be stored.
      Clamp time64 values passed to GDateTime functions to the valid range.
         Fixes a bug reported on the mailing list wherein a date of 0000-00-00
         in a MySql database would crash GnuCash. Such dates may come from a bad
         conversion of 1970-01-01 or from a crash.
      Add XSU to iso-4217-currencies
      Some banks include additional purpose information for a transaction in
         non-swift-section 17 (aka transaction text). If available, this
	 transaction text is put in front of the other purpose texts to provide
	 full transaction information. Adds a preference to control import
	 behaviour of transaction text.

    Add context to generic translatable string. This was suggested in
    	Bug 671615 by JÃ©rÃ´me Rapinat.
    Add scrub function to reduce the amount of lot links used. Only lot links
    	between two or more document lots must remain. All lot links between
	document and payment lots can be scrubbed.
    Add some date format checking and make sure generated dates are the correct
    	user selected format, not always locale format.
    Allow the ability to skip rows when importing transactions.
    Always use the price we display to calculate the current value of an
    	account.
    Better period totals formatting in Invoices.
    CSV Export: factor out function to generate regular expression.
    CSV Import transform macro into function.
    Convert ISO-8859-1 account chart templates to UTF-8.
    Correct txf output to use a minus sign, rather than parenthesis.
    Fix document type display for credit notes on owner report.
    Fix test-backend-dbi segfault with libdbi-0.9.0.
    Handle the case of scrubbing a lot link between two non-document lots.
    Make scrub in lot viewer scrub business lots using the new scrub functions.
    Move account type checking functions into the engine.
    Prevent older gnucash versions from opening a data file if previously
    	unhandled kvps are used.
    Python bindings. Add function gncVendorNextID, complementary to
        gncCustomerNextID.
    Re-enable loading and saving gnucashdotdir/accelerator-home on OSX.
    Refactor OS-specific ifdef to reduce code duplication, which results
        in reduced risk on typos in either branch
    Refactor get_pay_split into gncOwnerFindOffsettingSplit. In this form it
        can be used both for scrubbing lot links and for adding new payments
    Refactor gncOwnerReduceSplitTo out of reduce_biggest_split. It can now be
        used both for scrubbing and when applying payments
    Refactor gnc_doc_doc_link into gncOwnerSetLotLinkMemo and move it. It can
        now be used both for scrubbing and when applying payments
    Refactor scrub_doc_pay_link into scrub_other_link and make it more generic.
        It can now be used both to:
        * move a payment to a document lot (its original use case)
        * move a refund to a payment lot or the other way around
    Relax requirements for booleans in invoice line, accepting 'y' as well as
        'yes', 't' as well as 'true'.
    Replace C++ reserved words for future compatibility with C++.
    Rework assistant csv import regex code to eliminate the mandatory dummy
        field.
    Rewrite invoice payment logic to fix lot link proliferation.
    SQL: Save commodity namespace changes from template.
    Set default currency for French account chart templates.
    Tweak the get_pay_split function to prefer the best possible match.
    Use libsecret if available since gnome-keyring has been deprecated.
    Use more significant digits for SX function returns.
    Use same default setting for quotes in csv import and export.
    Widen the scope of the subsplit merge scrub function. When used in a
        strict sense it will only merge splits that are marked as subsplits
	of each other. In relaxed mode it will merge any split two splits
	that are both in the same lot and the same transaction.
    double_to_gnc_numeric: Return overflow error immediately on invalid input.
    Ensure that the root account is saved to the SQL backend.

2.6.0 - 29 Dec 2013

       The GnuCash development team proudly announces GnuCash 2.6.0,
       the latest stable release of the GnuCash Free Accounting
       Software. GnuCash Users can experience the following new features:

       * Preferences have been migrated from GConf to GSettings. This
	 is a simpler and more robust backend which writes to the OS's
	 native prefs -- defaults on OS X and the Registry on
	 MSWindows -- and allows us to remove several troublesome
	 dependencies including GConf, ORBit, and DBus. The change
	 includes a migration script that will run at Gnucash startup.

       * New date handling which allows GnuCash to use dates after March 2038.

       * Guile-2 compatibility: GnuCash now requires either Guile-1.8
         or Guile-2.0

       * Documents outside of GnuCash, images of receipts for example,
         can now be linked to transactions, with the facility of
         opening them in the default application for the document
         type.

       * Custom Reports can now be saved without renaming the report,
         and modifications can overwrite an existing report.

       * The import assistant now finishes much more quickly after
         assigning contra-accounts.

       * GnuCash now requires Gtk+-2.24.0 and GLib-2.26.0. Most of the
         dependencies on obsolete libraries have been removed; only
         libgnomecanvas remains. Unfortunately the effort to rewrite
         the register code to use GtkTreeModel wasn't completed in
         time, so GnuCash is not on the cusp of converting to Gtk3.

       * The Business Module has been substantially revamped,
         including support for Credit Notes and import of customers
         and vendors from a CSV file.

       * The Num field in the register display is now optionally
         per-split, so for example a check number can be entered for
         the checking account split and an invoice number for the
         expense account split.

       * GnuCash can now open locked books read-only so that more than
         one user can view a file. GnuCash still does not support
         multiple simultaneous writers.

       * By agreement of all authors, GnuCash is now licensed under
         the GNU General Public License Version 2 or later rather than
         simply Version 2. This allows derivative works to be licensed
         under the GPL Version 3 if the author of such a work so
         desires.

       * Fixed more than 500 bugs.

       For those keeping score, the following changes have occurred
       since 2.5.10:

       Bug Fixes:

       157247 - Asset account's "total" value should use most
                recent transaction prices
       710823 - libofx can supply broken UTF-8 for account id
       710824 - GnuCash should sanitise UTF-8 before serialising files
                to avoid writing broken unparsable XML.
       720555 - General Ledger - Can't Enter Transaction Amounts
       720556 - The Tip of the Day preference isn't getting saved
       720646 - New Book Tabs on Windows

       Other Changes:

       * Don't create a second account hierarchy page when cancelling
         the Hierarchy Assistant or when using Actions->New Account
         Hierarchy on an already open book.

       * Reset Warnings dialog: show translated warnings

       * The locale-names for Help and the Tutorial and Concepts Guide
         have been renamed to language-only so that, for example,
         someone using the Swiss-German locale will be shown help in
         German instead of English.

      Translations Updated: British, Dutch, French, Italian, Lithuanian.

2.5.10 - 15 December 2013
         This is the eleventh and final release in the UNSTABLE 2.5 series.
	 It is the second beta release. Barring any surprises, we will release
	 a STABLE 2.6.0 on 29 December.

	 Changes since the last release have been entirely bug fixes
	 and translation updates, though not all bug fixes had
	 associated bug reports. Note that WebKit 1.2 is now tested
	 for in configure; it had been 1.0, but GnuCash wouldn't
	 actually compile with versions earlier than 1.1.5.

	 Bug Fixes:

	 336843 - Attach images/files/urls to transactions:
	          Disable the "show attachment" menu item if the transaction
	          has no attached file.

	 627575 - Stylesheet names with non-alphanumeric characters

	          during qif import

	          Downgrade the error to a critical warning.
	 711317 - Indian Rupee Symbol appears as "?" marks
	 715123 - Post invoice problem, cannot unpost
	 719481 - GnuCash report crashes with Guile2
	 719521 - Missing radio button in "Edit security" dialog
	 719726 - Click on File -> Open seg-faults
	 720235 - Python bindings should load environment file just
	          like gnucash does
	 Fix Python tests to no longer require gsettings schemas installed.
	 Fix the CuteCash (Qt GUI based) build
	 Multi-currency "Post invoice" improvements
	 Protect gnc_mktime against bad dates.
	 Protect against null account pointers in a couple of place to
	     avoid asserts.
	 Qif Import Assistant: Don't disable the whole dialog, just the
	     Forward button
	 QifImport: Fix crash from attempting to import an empty file.
	 Add the ability to search for transactions that are, or are not,
	     book closing entries.
	 Move customer, bill, and invoice importers form the business menu
	     to the file menu.
	 Rename some directories in src/import-export so that the
	     gschema.xml.in.in files within them don't have pathnames that
	     are too long for tar when the GnuCash version exceeds 5 digits
	     (e.g., 2.5.10).

	 Translation Updates: Italian, German, French
	 New Translations: Arabic!

2.5.9 - 1 December 2013
         This is the tenth release in the UNSTABLE 2.5 series.
	 It is the first beta release.

	 Barring any surprises, there will be one more beta release in
	 two weeks, followed by the release of 2.6.0 on 29 December.

	 Changes since the last release have principally been code
	 cleanup, including KVP storage in the SQL Backend, Python
	 testing in out-of-source builds, test failures when using
	 Guile-2, ensure that saved state (especially KVP) is deleted
	 along with the primary object, use the progress bar when
	 loading the PriceDB.

	 Translator note: We found it advisable to correct some typos
	 and to add two translatable strings "Bill Information" and
	 "Voucher Information".

	 Bug Fixes:
	 644044 - Lots: SQL backend loses link to Gain/Loss Txn
 	 704506 - Connection loss to mysql after resume from hibernation

	 Translations updated: German, Italian

 2.5.8 - 17 November 2013

         This is the ninth release in the UNSTABLE 2.5 series. This
         release is the last alpha release.

	 String and feature freeze are now in effect: Only bug fixes
	 which have no effect on UI, API, or translatable strings
	 should be committed to trunk until after the release of
	 GnuCash 2.6, currently scheduled for 29 December 2013.

	 Translators: Please use the tarballs from this release to
	 prepare your translations.

	 New contributor Patrick has provided a beginning
	 implementation of linking attachments to transactions. This
	 is accessed through the Transaction menu and the transaction
	 context menu. In this initial version, linked files are
	 displayed in the default viewer for the file type. E.g., html
	 files will open in a browser and jpegs will open in the

 2.5.7 - 3 November 2013
       	 This is the eighth release in the UNSTABLE 2.5 series.

	 Register2 is now a configure option. Default builds,
	 including the Windows and Mac All-in-one packages, will use
	 only the old register. We've decided that it isn't ready for
	 general use and the principal author doesn't have time to
	 make it ready in time for a 2.6 release.

	 Frédéric Perrin has contributed a change to display currency
	 symbols whenever they are known and unambiguous.

	 Geert Janssens has cleaned up most of the issues from the
	 initial GSettings preference changes. There's a new
	 configure option, --with-xdg-data-dirs to override the
	 environment and defaults if necessary.

	 Building Gnucash now requires Automake version 1.11 or later.

	 Configure will abort if --enable-ofx is set but no libofx
	 configuration files are found.  Budget periods may no longer
	 set to values greater than the budget's num_periods, and the
	 budget options descriptions will wrap. Contributed by Robert
	 Ratliff.

	 Bug Fixes:

 2.5.6 - 7 October 2013
       	 This is the seventh release in the UNSTABLE 2.5 series.

	 Geert Janssens has rewritten the preferences system to use
	 GSettings from GIO (GLib) instead of GConf. This is a simpler
	 and more robust backend which writes to the OS's native prefs
	 -- defaults on OS X and the Registry on MSWindows -- and
	 allows us to remove several troublesome dependencies
	 including GConf, ORBit, and DBus. The change includes a
	 migration script that will run at Gnucash startup.

	 WARNING: the saved settings in gconf are not (yet) migrated
         to gsettings !  running gnucash as of this commit will start
         you with default values for all preferences !  You can of
         course change your preferences, your changes will be saved
         properly in gsettings and restored when you restart
         gnucash. But what has been set in GConf before will basically
         be ignored.

 2.5.3 - 7 July 2013
         This is the fourth release in the UNSTABLE 2.5 series.

	 Customized report settings can now be saved without renaming
	 the report, and updates saved directly replacing the previously
	 saved report or "saved as" to a new name.

	 It's now possible to post multiple invoices from the find
	 dialog. GnuCash was crashing if you searched for all unposted
	 invoices, selected two or more of them, and posted them.
	 This was because the list of invoices to be posted changed
	 while it was being processed.  As part of fixing this the
	 prompt for post date, due date, etc. will only be given once,
	 not once per invoice.

	 information in a JSON format.

	 Christian Stimming fixed the very long wait time for the UI to
	 become responsive when running the import matcher.

	 Also some bug fixes, package upgrades, and minor improvements.

 2.5.0 - 30 Mar 2013

         The Gnucash Development Team is pleased to release Gnucash 2.5.0,
	 the first release of an unstable series leading to Gnucash 2.6.0.

	 This release is UNSTABLE and SHOULD NOT BE USED in production.

	 Robert Fewell has contributed a rewrite of the ledger
	 (Gnucash's primary interface window) to use the GtkTreeModel
	 (select "register 2" from the menu) as well as a new CSV
	 import/export facility for account trees.

	 Gnucash now requires Gtk+-2.24 and GLib-2.26. We've removed
	 most of the dependencies on libraries obsoleted by project
	 Ridley and will be in position to move to Gtk+-3.x once the
	 GtkTreeModel register window work is complete. This means
	 that Gnucash 2.5 requires Debian 6, RHEL 6, or one of the
	 more aggressive distributions like Ubuntu.

	 Gnucash now works with Guile-2.0.

	 The business module has been revamped and we introduce a new
	 feature, Credit Notes. It is now possible to import customers
	 and vendors from a CSV file as well.

	 The "Num" field is now optionally per-split rather than
	 per-transaction.

	 When opening a locked "book" one now has the option of
	 opening it read-only. Note that Gnucash is still a
	 single-user program and that the database backends are still
	 used only as a data store.

	 Gnucash is no longer subject to the "2038" bug, so that
	 30-year mortgages can now be entered correctly.

	 By agreement of all authors we have relicensed Gnucash to the
	 Gnu Public License Version 2 or later from just Version 2.

       for users.

 2.4.0 - 20 Dec 2010

       The GnuCash development team proudly announces GnuCash 2.4.0,
       the latest stable release of the GnuCash Free Accounting
       Software. With this new release series, GnuCash can use an SQL
       database using SQLite3, MySQL or PostgreSQL. It runs on
       GNU/Linux, *BSD, Solaris, Microsoft Windows and Mac OSX.

       Major changes in the 2.4.0 release include

       * In addition to the XML backend, Gnucash can now use a
         SQLite3, MySQL or PostgreSQL database to store the data. This
         is a new implementation using libdbi. It supports all
         features including the business features.  In order to build
         with this, add --enable-dbi to the configure command.  In
         addition to the libdbi-dev package for your distribution, you
         will also need the appropriate DBD (libdbi driver) package
         for sqlite3, mysql or postgresql.

       * As a replacement for the current GtkHTML HTML engine used to
         display reports and graphs, Gnucash can use WebKit. WebKit is
         the engine used by Google Chrome on Windows and Safari on
         Apple.  In order to build with this, add
         --with-html-engine=webkit to the configure command.  You will
         need an appropriate webkit-dev package.  On win32, you will
         need to download the webkit-1.1.90-win32.zip file from the
         source repository and put it into the downloads directory of
         your gnucash build area.

       * Updated AqBanking on Win32.</li>

 2.3.0 - 14 May 2009
 	 o Welcome to GnuCash 2.3.0 the first of several unstable releases of
	 the GnuCash Open Source Accounting Software which will eventually lead
	 to the stable version 2.4.0. This release is the very first to use an
	 SQLite3 database as the default data store.  It is intended for
	 developers and adventurous testers who want to help tracking down bugs.
	 o WARNING WARNING WARNING - Make sure you make backups of any files
	 used in testing versions of GnuCash in the 2.3.x series. Although the
	 developers go to great lengths to ensure that no data will be lost we
	 cannot guarantee that your data will not be affected if for some
	 reason GnuCash crashes in testing these releases.
	 o PLEASE TEST TEST AND TEST SOME MORE any and all features important
	 to you. Then post any bugs you find to bugzilla
	 https://bugs.gnucash.org/enter_bug.cgi
	 o If you have the urge to help beyond testing please get involved in
	 the discussions on the GnuCash mailing lists which you will find at
	 https://www.gnucash.org.  Please see https://wiki.gnucash.org/wiki/Development
	 on how to get involved.
	 o Major new features:
	    * All features, including business features, are supported by a new
		SQL datastore, which can use SQLite3 (default), MySQL or PostgreSQL.
		The legacy XML data format is still supported
		* Replacement of the aging GtkHTML engine used for reports/charts
		with the WebKit engine used by Apple's Safari and Google's Chrome
		web browsers.
	 o PS I'm not going to list the many minor features changed or updated in
	 this release because obviously there is so much that has changed.

 2.2.0 - 14 July 2007
  	 o Welcome to the GnuCash 2.2.0 Release.
	 o With this new release series, GnuCash is available on Microsoft
	 Windows for the first time, and it also runs on GNU/Linux, *BSD,
	 Solaris and Mac OSX.
	 o This release has only a few user-visible new features, except for
	 the completed port to the Microsoft Windows operating system. In
	 summary, the following features are new, compared to the older 2.0.x
	 series:
	 o Port to Microsoft Windows completed. Note that Windows 2000, XP, or
	 Vista is required; GnuCash does not run on Windows 98 or 95.
	 o Data file notice: In version 2.1.2 the format for scheduled
	 transactions in the data file was changed. Files using the old format
	 will be read without problems by this new version, but the new
	 version of GnuCash only writes the new format. The new file format
	 cannot be loaded by older versions of GnuCash. (If you try, the file
	 will fail to be loaded with an error message.) As a result, if you
	 begin using the new Gnucash, and you have data files with scheduled
	 transactions, then these files will not be readable by older
	 versions. If you have to make a new data file readable by older
	 versions of GnuCash, this can be achieved by deleting all records of
	 scheduled transactions in the scheduled transaction editor.
	 o SWIG is now used instead of g-wrap for providing language bindings.
	 o The Scheduled Transaction list view is now improved and summarized
	 more compactly. The Since-Last-Run dialog has been simplified.
	 o Check printing has been improved, with new formats and simpler
	 format descriptions.
	 o Automatic saving of the data file was added.
	 o Bugfixes and improvements since the last version 2.1.5 include:
	 o Updated translations.
	 o Improved handling of Online Banking wizard on Windows.

	 o Compared to the 2.0.x series, there are only very few user-visible
	 new features, except for the completed port to the Microsoft Windows
	 operating system. Minor new features compared to the 2.0.x series
	 are;
	 o The Scheduled Transaction Editor and Management dialogs have been
	 integrated into the overall GnuCash User Interface to give the user a
	 more consistent experience in creating scheduled transactions.
	 o Internally, the programming language wrappers are no longer being
	 generated by the not-so-well-maintained package "g-wrap" but instead
	 by the well-established wrapper generator "SWIG". In effect, gnucash
	 does no longer depend on g-wrap anymore but uses SWIG now.
	 o New printing formats for check printing
	 o Bugfixes and improvements since the last version 2.1.0 include:
	 o Internal GObject integration is much more advanced by now
	 o Crash on OFX import crashing has been fixed
	 o Windows timezone problems fixed

 	 o Online Banking/HBCI improvements: Debit notes are fixed
 	 again; Bank-internal money transfers are now supported, if
 	 the HBCI bank offers them; Setup wizard can now works with
 	 HBCI, OFX-Connect, and other AqBanking backends; Fix
 	 character encoding issues in utf-8 locales; Fix date interval
 	 in the import transaction matcher for OFX and HBCI import;

 	 o Add configure macros for mips, mipsel, arm, and m68k; Fix
 	 compilation on OpenBSD 64bit architectures
 	 o Updated translations: German, Italian, Kinyarwanda

 1.8.11 - 06 Feb 2005
 	 o Add extra sanity checks and verbose error message if the setup
	 wizard of aqhbci cannot be found.
	 o Fix potentially missing initialization of gwenhywfar library, as
	 reported by Peter O'Gorman on Max OS X.
	 o Properly accumulate splits (bug #165053).  Also fixes a (related)
	 memory leak
	 o Add explicit dependency on business-utils.
	 o Adapt to latest changes in aqbanking; external wizard name is no
	 longer hard-coded here but is asked from aqbanking.
	 o Enable debit notes again in HBCI.
	 o Update German translation.
	 o Thomas Bushnell's patch to protect non-backup pruning (#164875)
	 o Add the transaction guid to some error warning messages.
	 o Fix HBCI date range for statement download.
	 o Fix the last-day-of-month computation for leap years.

 1.8.10 - 11 Dec 2004
 	 o Don't use C++/C99 declarations.  Declare variables at the top of
	 the function.
	 o Updated British English, Czech, Italian, Russian, German,
	 Brazilian Portuguese, Dutch, French, Spanish, translations.
	 o Fabien COELHO's zero-balance patch to remove accounts of zero
	 balance from the report.
	 o Fix a broken recursion problem.  Don't call show-acct? from
	 use-acct? so we don't recurse ad flictum.  This recursive call isn't
	 necessary, just have use-acct? recurse unto itself.
	 o look in ${srcdir} for build-config.scm.in
	 o Work around problems with libltdl3.
	 o don't automatically try to (require 'format), so gnucash will build
	 on an slib-3 system.
	 o Added quote sources for Indian Mutual Funds.
	 o Skip the case when a token is the empty string. This caused many
	 warnings about a NULL kvp_frame lookup.

	 o applied Vasil's patch to improve the transaction report for HTML
	 export purposes.

	 when working with large account trees (>500 accounts).  The new code
	 caches the quickfill tree so that it is shared by all register
	 windows.
	 o create gnc:current-saved-reports, as the file to store saved
	 reports from cstim.  Autoload the saved-reports file at startup
	 (after config.user/config.auto is loaded).
	 o Added gnc:report-generate-saved-forms that will generate the scheme
	 code necessary to create a new report from the saved options of an
	 old report.
	 o Added example Menu item "File -> Save all reports" that will call
	 the new report saving function for all reports. This would need more
	 work so that not all reports are saved but only the currently
	 selected one -- any volunteer may feel free to add that.
	 o Fix saving of report: It now appends to
	 ~/.gnucash/saved-reports-1.8 Statusbar tip is now more verbose.
	 o Add toolbar element for saving the current report.
	 o Add function for saving one particular report to the
	 ~/.gnucash/saved-reports-1.8 file. Add extra menu only for customized
	 reports.
	 o Remove the previous function for saving all reports since it is no
	 longer necessary.
	 o Apply David Reiser's patch for Quicken(tm) cheques with stub.
	 o Apply David Grant's patch to add TD Efunds.
	 o make the desktop file HIG compliant.
	 o change the gtkhtml order to search for >= 1.1 before < 1.1, in
	 order to try to fix #84707 on systems with multiple versions of
	 gtkhtml.
	 o Perry Smith's Null Account Patch.  Make sure the security is a real
	 string before appending an account separator, so we don't try to
	 create a "null" account.
	 o Add option to include zero-amount splits in computations.
	 o fix xaccAccountGetBalanceAsOfDate() to properly compute the balance
	 at the end of the split list.
	 o Major change for HBCI, back-ported from HEAD. The HBCI online
	 banking is no longer based on the openhbci library but instead on the
	 aqbanking library https://sf.net/projects/aqbanking which is Martin
	 Preuss' successor of openhbci. This means that now aqbanking-0.9.5 is
	 required instead of any openhbci package.
	 o Fixes for x86_64
	 o Update for new LibOfx, this among other things, gives gnucash
	 Microsoft OFC support.
	 o Duplicate match tweaks in import code
	 o Andreas Rottmann's patch to support g-wrap 1.9.
	 o provide a default account name so we don't crash when someone
	 imports a broken QIF that has a !Account without an account name.
	 o Daniel Lindenaar's patch to implement a check-box in the Invoice
	 Post Dialog (with a default in the File Preferences) to choose to
	 accumulate splits when posting an invoice, or post a 1:1 mapping.
	 o Phil Longstaff's patch to prevent duplicate pricedb entries.
	 o Heath Martin's x86_64 patch
	 o Mark search criteria for translation -- somehow this had been
	 missed all the time.
	 o Change currency mnemonic for "New Israeli Shekel" from "ILS" to
	 "NIS".
	 o Identified and fixed several places with untranslated strings.
	 o Add configure check for libofx version 0.7.0 and respective error
	 message. Update docs.
	 o Improve importer performance by matching imported transactions only
	 against transactions in the proper time interval.
	 o send an event when a payment is processed so the invoice gets
	 updated as "paid" in the search window.
	 o Make sure we set the proper search-type when we create the query,
	 otherwise the search will fail later.

 1.8.9  - 11 Apr 2004
 	 o Updated Polish translation by GNOME PL Team, updated French, Czech,
	   Spanish, Russian, Dutch, German and Italian translations.
	 o dump-finance-quote - Be more explicit when a lookup fails.
	 o log-replay - Increase read buffer size.
	 o Make sure to verify that the items in the reconcile hash are still
	   around after a refresh.
	 o When the commodity is changed, then set the currency to the
	   currency of the last price entered for this commodity.
	 o Add Hungarian account templates by Sulyok Peter
	 o Patch by Geoff Kassel to work on OpenBSD (allow user to set
	   diffcmd).
	 o Don't test double KVPs, on the theory that they will soon be
	   deprecated.
	 o  When computing the aging report, ignore splits that belong to
	   closed lots.  This way we wont get the wrong values when the invoice
	   falls outside the 360-day window but its payment falls inside the
	   window.
	 o Add gnc_getline() function to read an unlimited line-length from a
	   file (so you're not limited to a buffer size with fgets() and the
	   like). It is similar to the getline(3) on Linux except the API is
	   different and it will always set the return string.
	 o Add workaround code for openhbci/chipcard problem.
	 o Add gnc_lookup_date_option() function.
	 o Add gnc_ui_account_get_balance_in_currency() function.
	 o Add preferences for summarybar.
	 o Add xaccAccountConvertBalanceToCurrencyAsOfDate() function
	 o Summarybar can now display a grand total of all commodities,
	   profits of a period of time and net assets at the end of the period;
	   summarybar can be configured with some options under
	   edit->preferences.
	 o Create two new functions to centralize date-selection option
	   creation.
	 o Export the new scheme functions.
	 o Modify Herbert's patch to centralize the date-selection option
	   code.
	 o Use the new centralized date-selection option-creation code.
	 o Fix a typo in the help (was --disable-gui).
	 o Add db-4.2 to the list of databases we search.
	 o Fix a problem with opt style installs.
	 o Rename from_xxx and to_xxx account tree widgets to left_xxx and
	   right_xxx.
	 o If in "accountant mode" call "transfer from" "credit account" and
	   "transfer to" "debit account" and interchange account trees.
	 o Remove the RECN cell from payable/receivable to stop confusing
	   people.
	 o Change Ukrainian "UAG" into "UAH"
	 o Commented out setting the memo always to "Auto-created split" due
	   to popular request.
	 o Fix for part of bug only allow auto-create SXes which have splits
	   to be created.
	 o HBCI transfer template management GUI added by Bernd Wagner.
	 o Added instructions about running under valgrind.
	 o Added a large set of valgrind suppressions for both guile and
	   gnucash.
	 o Change the reg_type to SEARCH_LEDGER so all the 'action' types
	   appear.
	 o Remove unused 'ledger_status' widget.
	 o At least be consistent about the background coloring of the month
	   labels, even if we're still not using GTK theming correctly.
	 o Destroy the transient window when the widget is destroyed.
	 o Make the advance and remind spin-buttons editable.
	 o Change the upper bound on the advance and remind spins to 365
	   [days], with a page-size of 30 [days].
	 o Disallow the Scheduling of being-editing transactions in the
	   Register, preventing a class of unbalacned SX template transactions
	   from being entered and propagated through the system.
	 o Fix nasty memory-corruption issue; insufficient bounds checking on
	   array index.
	 o Better handling of various error cases in transaction-creation.
	 o When we have a problem parsing a credit/debit cell, indicate to the
	   user what occurred.
	 o Use the account-list filtering capability of the GncAccountSel to
	   only show/allow-creation-of valid account-types in the loan-druid.
	 o Add ':' to the token list of allowable characters in the formula
	   cell.
	 o Fix precedence bug screwing up loan review page.
	 o Don't need to require format; main.scm handles it, and the default
	   "format" (simple-format) is sufficient to handle everything we need.
	   This allows gnucash to work with slib3.
	 o Add code to remove "intl/Makefile po/Makefile" from AC_OUTPUT in
	   configure.in prior to calling gettextize to make sure that you can
	   build from CVS with recent versions of gettextize.  Tested with both
	   RH9 and RH7.3 to make sure it works with both old and new.
	 o Move variable declaration to the top of the block.
	 o Make sure we always have intl and po Makefiles in the configure
	   script.  Sometimes it was ripped out without being replaced.

 1.8.8  - 17 Nov 2003
 	 o HBCI - Improve error message when receiving zero balance from bank.
	 o Add account template for Swiss German businesses "KMU" by Tom
	   Winterhalder
	 o Add *big* account template for German businesses "SKR04" by Betina
	   Schmidt
	 o Add Catalan and Turkish translation, Updated German, Italian,
	   Czech, Greek and Dutch translations.
	 o Add Turkish account template. Updated Greek account templates.
	 o Remove debian scripts
	 o Add a comment about minimum string length
	 o Fix the ISO_DATELEN to be "long enough"
	 o Fix handling of HBCI direct debits (fix wrong textkey). Fix and
	   initially implement handling of multiple banks/users/customers.
	 o Fixed extremely stupid, old bug that causes weird HBCI errors.
	   Improved user messages.
	 o Refactor some GUI code. Improve user messages.
	 o BillTermDecRef should have been BillTermIncRef when setting new
	   bill term.
	 o Applied Frank Pavageau's patch regarding capital gains to handle
	   split transactions.
	 o Don't make a timespec with tv_sec == 0.  Fixes some tests on the
	   alpha platform.

 1.8.7  - 14 Sept 2003
 	 o Use <libofx/libofx.h> instead of "libofx/libofx.h" as it's not part
	   of our system. Fixes a dependency problem in 1.8.6 release.
	 o Small fix from hawkfan to get tests to work when building outside
	   srcdir.
	 o Fix a bug introduced by Matthew -- ANSI C does not allow you to
	   declare a variable in the middle of an expression.  Move the
	   declaration to the top of the function.
	 o We don't need the trailing semi-colon because the #include adds
	   one.  The double semi-colon causes build failures in some cases.

 1.8.6  - 11 Sept 2003
 	 o Updated Spanish, Greek, French, Czech, Slovak translations
	 o Fixed extremely stupid bug in the import value setting workaround.
	 o Fixed problem with SX formula_cell calls
	 o Merge missing part of 2003-05-28 commit.  The log format changes
	   didn't get commited for some reason, making the log replayer
	   completely unusable.
	 o Fixed crash during dialog startup on Solaris.
	 o Turn off scheme garbage collection during query->scm and scm->query
	   conversion.  It shaves about 50% off the test-scm-query-string tests.
	 o Make test-scm-query-string test deterministic by seeding the RNG
	   with a known value.
	 o Add a "slots" parameter to allow for future expansion.  Right now
	   this is completely ignored.

 1.8.5  - 17 Aug 2003
 	 o Add IS_PAID column and the ability to search for paid/not-paid
	   invoices.
	 o Add HBCI online transfer templates and make usable
	 o Fix a bug where if you unpost an invoice and don't bring the
	   TaxTables up to date, the total value shown in the register is
	   different depending on whether the cursor is on the current line
	   or not.
	 o Don't constantly resize the invoice window every time we update
	   ourselves.
	 o Updated Italian, Brazilian Portuguese, German, Czech, Dutch and
	   British English translation.
	 o Add Subtotal and Tax labels in the summary bar to print the
	   Invoice's total amounts.
	 o Change the log format to use GUID instead of C pointers, use
	   ISO8601 instead of proprietary form and log the Notes field.
	 o Port new log replay module from HEAD.
	 o Re-enable reversed legend in stacked barcharts. Needs Guppi 0.40.4
	   a.k.a. Guppi CVS, though, to actually work.
	 o Update the Polish Zloty for its new ISO currency code.
	 o Add ability to sort by Action and Notes.
	 o Fix the vendor window title to use the company name, not the
	   contact name. Change the message when the company name is left blank.
	 o Create a new "date format" widget to let the user choose a date
	   format (and see the results of what the date would look like).
	 o Add "Deluxe Personal Check" type. Add support for printing to
	   "deluxe" personal checks.  This prints the check "sideways" on a
	   US-Letter configuration.
	 o Backport the QueryList widget and associated usage (this allows
	   more places to have sortable column displays for query results)
	 o Improve HBCI error handling. Add more user feedback functions.
	 o Add support for KtoBlzCheck, a small checking package for
	   destination account numbers for German banks. Very small, very useful
	   https://sourceforge.net/projects/ktoblzcheck
	 o TRANSLATION_HOWTO: Added, by Jon Lapham
	 o Add API to the plugin modules to allow post-processing (scrubbing)
	   of the book after it is loaded from XML.  This allows a plug-in to
	   post-process the complete book.
	 o Create a scrub function to clear up bogus tax tables due to a bug
	   which could cause tax tables to get created ad-nausium if you post
	   and then unpost an invoice.
	 o Create a scrub function to clear up bogus bill terms due to a bug
	   which could cause bill terms to get created due to post/unpost of
	   invoices.
	 o Enable the exchange-rate dialog on "search ledger" registers.
	 o Raise the import window after choosing a file.
	 o Change dialog statements to allow for embedded percent signs in the
	   messages.  In other words, don't allow user input into the format
	   string of a printf.
	 o Change how the billterms option menu is used so it will change
	   properly if you change the invoice's owner.
	 o Don't use gnc:reverse-account-balance? to determine whether to
	   reverse the balance -- base it purely on the report type.
	 o Fix gncBillTermCopy() so it PROPERLY copies the bill term.
	 o Tolerate some HBCI banks failure of the GetSystemId-job.
	 o Don't allow selection of directory for save file.
	 o Add fancy-invoice report, to show what else is possible.  It's not
	   really useful per se, but it is another example for users.  To be
	   useful it requires some custom editing.
	 o Limit the commodity choices based upon the current account type.
	 o Add a new argument to the dialog creation functions to specify what
	   types of commodities should be presented.Also tweak the title of the
	   dialog based upon this argument.  Remove the "new" button when the
	   dialog is limited strictly to currencies.
	 o Show the running balance column by default in the register report.
	 o Annotate the window title to indicate whether a register is for a
	   single account or it includes all subaccounts.
	 o Change the register close dialog to include a cancel option.
	 o Don't close the register if the user cancelled.
	 o If the user has manually entered an amount, then stop automatically
	   updated the amount when the date is changed.
	 o Refactor many HBCI functions to eventually enable queued processing
	   of several HBCI jobs.
	 o Add a "retained earnings" item under equity, and change the title
	   to include the start date (Balance Sheet report).
	 o Don't print the "handling-request" messages when getting stock
	   quotes.
	 o Display selected pixmap when opening an options window.
	 o Fix 'Save As' so it can write to non-existing files.
	 o New data file should have same uid/gids original file.
	 o Added Italian account templates by Lorenzo Cappelletti
	 o Change HBCI online transfer action so that first the gnucash
	   Transaction is created and only after that the HBCI connection is
	   started. Necessary for later implementation of offline queuing and
	   multi-job execution.
	 o Clarify the part of the HBCI setup about potentially adding HBCI
	   accounts manually.
	 o Add a couple of extra checks to prevent crashing if the commodity
	   attached to a price quote has disappeared.
	 o Provide a new warning message before deletion if a commodity has
	   any price quotes.  If the user deletes the commodity anyway, removed
	   any quotes are based on the commodity
	 o Enhance the get prices routine to handle a request with a NULL
	   currency.
	 o Fix a crash where removing items in the wrong order could cause
	   "Bad Things" to happen
	 o Sort the bills before displaying them, so they appear in a
	   consistent order (by date due).
	 o Fix a bunch more rounding errors, and add more precision to the
	   price.
	 o Change the description and action of Invoice and Payment
	   Transactions/Splits, to make it easier to print a check off the
	   posted transactions.
	 o Add Debit and Credit totals to Register report.
	 o Differentiate between "file is already locked" and "we can't create
	   the lockfile" so we can let the user know.
	 o Fix the message to be more appropriate when we hit a READONLY
	   error.
	 o Various Postgres backend fixes
	 o Add button for manual adding of HBCI accounts. Requires latest
	   OpenHBCI 0.9.13
	 o Add saving of the HBCI_API so that bank's status changes will now
	   be remembered immediately.
	 o Add "(Report)" strings to the various columns displayed in the
	   report currency.
	 o Set the date-entered on invoice transactions to "now" instead of
	   the post date.  Thi lets us know when an invoice was actually posted,
	   or a payment was actually made.
	 o Support "gain/loss" balancing splits on stocks
	 o Apply patch to fix a number of off-by-one bugs in the loan druid.
	 o Adapted to latest gnucash-docs changes, by Jon Lapham
	 o Add code to read XML files with real namespace declarations.
	 o Make sure we define PWD, as not all shells define it properly.
	 o Workaround for multi-currency importing bug.

 1.8.4  - 25 May 2003
 	 o Fix transfer dialog to nothang if OK button is clicked w/o filling
	   in dialog properly.
	 o Add HTML::Parser to the list of items checked/installed.
	 o Updated translations:  Brazilian Portuguese, Czech, Italian, German
	 o Fix the "View xxxbar" menu items to track properly when a new data
	   file is opened. Consolidate the code for manipulating the
	   View/Statusbar and View/Summarybar menu items.  Work around a Gnome
	   MDI bug as best as possible.
	 o The numeric test regex was broken and would fail on ALL numerics,
	   causing all imports to be of value zero.
	 o Fix for creating new template transactions [from Scheduling
	   existing transactions], such that they have valid Posted dates.
	 o Fix for existing/old data without posted dates.  If we encounter
	   the condition, fixup the transaction's Posted date to that of the
	   Entered date.
	 o Add LOT_IS_CLOSED and LOT_BALANCE query parameter methods
	 o Fixes for 64-bit architectures.
	 o Add gncQueryGetBooks() API to return list of books in a query.
	 o Add INVOICE_POST_LOT query parameter methods
	 o Add an api to force an event even when events are suspended.
	   Without such an API, events can be lost if the event system is
	   suspended when the event comes in.
	 o Added gnucash wrappers around gnome-print's rotate, translate,
	   gsave, and grestore APIs.  All to allow sideways printing (by
	   rotating the image).
	 o Wrap the new print-session apis.
	 o Modify the AC_GWRAP_CHECK_GUILE() macro to take an argument, the
	   g-wrap module directory.  Then actually test that the g-wrap module
	   loads.  This should detect systems without slib installed.
	 o New gwrap check macro
	 o Deal properly when there are no prices for a commodity.
	 o Supply a start date (as well as an end date) and don't print
	   invoices that occur prior to the start date or after the end date.
	   The aging information ignores the start date, but not the end date.
	   This means the aging information will always be accurate through the
	   end date (even if all the invoices and payments are not displayed).
	 o Limit the itemized invoices/payments to the start/end date range,
	   but print out a "Balance" line if there is a non-zero balance as of
	   the start date.
	 o Nikos Charonitakis's account chart updates: added new carloan
	   account chart, updated account chart.
	 o Use the correct columns when printing the Gain column, don't reuse
	   the same column as profit; we want to report different values.
	 o Don't let the user do anything with the options dialog until
	   Apply() finishes.
	 o Had the wrong number of arguments in gnc:account-get-balance-at-date
	 o Add some (commented out) code to support a start date for computing
	   the Net Income (aka Net Profit) in the Balance Sheet.
	 o Move the instantiation of File -> Properties into main-window.scm
	   (out of business-gnome.scm) for future cases where we might decide to
	   ship the business modules separately.
	 o Fix the ofx test program to make sure it links on many weird
	   platforms.
	 o When we are asked to reload the report, queue the request, queue a
	   draw event, and then return immediately.  When the draw event
	   happens, load the report then.  This lets you hit Apply and then OK
	   before the report finishes loading.
	 o Make sure we can find libofx/libofx.h
	 o Include split transactions in the filtering of the transaction
	   report.
	 o Use a 'from' date to better compute the Net Income on the report.
	 o Change the default Search Operation for numerics from "less than"
	   to "equals" -- so by default you would search for an exact value.
	 o "eval" changed API on guile-1.6.  Use the existing API to convert a
	   delta symbol to a delta time.
	 o Call eval with the right number of arguments based on early or late
	   versions.
	 o Change the date format string to be consistent with other places
	   (e.g. the check print dialog) and use '%' instead of '~'.
	 o Make the Bill Due Days option selectable based on the setting of
	   Notify Bills Due?
	 o Don't crash if you remove the last entry and then add another one.
	 o Deal with the case where the first transaction found for a
	   particular company is a payment
	 o Also print out any overpayment in the total column.
	 o Catch errors when running the child reports so we display the
	   failed report backtrace but also display an error and continue with
	   the multicolumn report.

 1.8.3  - 03 May 2003
 	 o Updated translations: Italian, Swedish, Danish, British,
	   Traditional Chinese, French, German, Tamil, Brazilian Portuguese.
	 o Turn off the report-total by default
	 o The Euroland currency rates were inverted in the transfer dialog.
	 o Chris Morgan's Bayesian Matching code, to match transactions based
	   on Bayesian filtering of previously matched transactions.
	 o Fix a bug in the account name list when you you filtered down to no
	   accounts it would ignore the filter.
	 o The Account Separator option was moved to the Accounts page,
	   reference correctly.
	 o Fix the keypress handlers so they work properly for both the text
	   entry widget and the calendar popup widget.
	 o Force the cursor to the first line of a transaction split before
	   disabling "double line" mode in the register.  This prevents the
	   register refresh code from trying to update a cell that is no longer
	   visible.
	 o Fix HBCI close-on-finished checkbutton.
	 o Add descriptions of new HBCI actions.
	 o OpenBSD fixes by Todd T. Fries
	 o New report "income vs. day of week" by Andy Wingo
	 o Fix a couple strings to improve comments when owners and accounts
	   are missing.  Direct the user to select them in the report options.
	 o When building the "name + address" string, check if the company
	   name and contact name are the same and, if so, only print one of
	   them.
	 o Fix the glade settings so resizing the window will properly resize
	   the widgets.
	 o Save the entry cells before adding an it to the invoice, otherwise
	   it wont get sorted properly.
	 o Add support in business code for the to-charge amount.
	 o Don't ask the user in the general case when making changes to
	   entries.  Generally the user should be allowed to make whatever
	   changes they want without being pestered.
	 o Guile-1.6 requires empty lists to be quoted.
	 o Symbols are not strings in guile-1.6.
	 o Fix "WeekDelta" and add TwoWeekDelta.
	 o Pop up a dialog if the user tries to transfer from a non-currency
	   account, and don't let them do it.
	 o Evaluate the date during get_predicate() in case the user just "hit
	   return" (and the auto-evaluate didn't happen).
	 o Fix crash during import of investment accounts.
	 o Fixes for GCC 3.3 warnings
	 o Fix HBCI user messages where chip cards were confused with key
	   files.
	 o Adapt to latest changes in OpenHBCI CVS.
	 o Applied Tomas Pospisek's patch to the transaction report.
	 o Fix the description of gnc:mdi-show-progress.
	 o Enable changing the "ID" for different business objects.
	 o Fix the percentage calculations so we don't get GtkCritical
	   warnings.
	 o Disable the test-scm-query-import test, since it breaks on
	   guile-1.6
	 o Move currency conversion to gnc-pricedb.c
	 o Improve report for stocks and funds not denominated in report
	   currency.
	 o QIF imports don't assume that a date of the form XXXXXXXX is always
	   YYYYMMDD. Make sure a 4-digit year "makes sense"
	 o Fix hbci and ofx test for handling --disable correctly.
	 o Fix openhbci macro again so that it uses a C check program.

	   no payables accounts.
	 o Fix some of the accounts in the tree to be more accurate to the
	   real world.
	 o Only set ReadOnly status for Invoices, not Payments.
	 o Fix several bugs in QIF importer
	 o Recognize even more error codes from OpenHBCI.
	 o No longer assume that transaction with type OFX_OTHER are
	   investment transactions.
	 o Don't add income accounts to bills, or expense accounts to
	   invoices.  This should help further reduce user confusion with what
	   to do when entering invoices.

 	 o Welcome to Release Candidate 3
	 o Fixed build issues introduced in last release
	 o Fix compile errors on SuSE 8.0 + 8.1
	 o Update translations, po/ru.po by Vitaly Lipatov, po/el.po by
	   ta_panta_rei@flashmail.com

	 o Scrub hbci include paths to prevent gcc 3.x compile errors.
	 o Default the OFX import directory to the directory of the last OFX
	   file imported, or the user's home dir for the first export.
	   Remembered across invocations of gnucash.
	 o Default the save directory to the directory of the last file used.
	   Default the exports directory to the directory of the last file
	   exported, or the user's home dir for the first export. Remembered
	   across invocations of gnucash.
	 o Correctly handle the case where no stocks have been defined and the
	   user asks gnucash to get price quotes.

	   units/fractions separator is a comma can request web pages.
	 o Add "Default Report Currency" preference.
	 o Set invoice currency based on owner's currency.
	 o Use invoice's currency for printing the invoice.

	   gets around an issue with guile 1.6.
	 o Add a checkbox to search-for-all
	 o Changes to make the build system work on multiple architectures and
	   with multiple versions of the autotools suite.  Make generated g-wrap
	   sources depend on config.status.
	 o Remove restriction on guile versions > 1.4 Provide a version
	   dependant load path variable for the SRFI location. (Empty in 1.6
	   since they're bundled with guile.)
	 o Limit QIF matches against only the accounts in the old group, so we
	   don't match against ourselves.  This should limit the matches to only
	   "reasonable" matches.
	 o Remove "user name" and "user address" preferences, as they are no
	   longer used by anything.
	 o Create a taxtable option type using the new generic optionmenu code
	 o Create a default customer and default vendor taxtable option for
	   the "File Properties" option menu.
	 o Reset the search-type to "New Search" if we end up displaying no
	   results.
	 o Use the "New Search Limit" pref to decide when to start a new
	   search vs. when refine the search.
	 o Create two new global preferences: "Notify Bills Due?" and "Bills
	   Due Days"
	 o Added sources needed for OS X to dist.
	 o Lots more bugfixes, see changelog.

 1.7.7  - 05 January 2003
 	 o Welcome to Release Candidate 2
	 o Give the user better feedback on exactly what the exchange rate
	   means.
	 o Better handling of corrupt XML data files.  Print better error
	   messages for unknown tags, or mismatched start/end tags.
	 o When checking for gtkhtml-1.1, make the lack of pkg-config a fatal
	   error. Also check for pkgconfig
	 o Updated translations, po/de.po,
	 o Fix HBCI reparent warnings. Make the PIN dialog a bit nicer.
	 o Fixes to PostgreSQL backend.
	 o Changed the "ALTER TABLE table ADD COLUMN..." statements to conform
	   to the current Postgres implementation (and SQL 92) standard by
	   putting the DEFAULT modifier in a separate ALTER statement.  This was
	   reported by Christopher B. Browne.
	 o Implement unpost function in invoices.
	 o Correctly open a help window when the initial URL contains a label
	   component to it.
	 o Make the reconciliation window respect the 'include subaccount'
	   flag any time it opens a register.  Consolidate logic for opening a
	   new register. Enhance the reconciliation start window to update the
	   ending value when this flag is changed.
	 o If the amount is monetary, map the keypad decimal key to the
	   correct decimal character for the locale.
	 o Fix malformed URLs for bringing up a report options window.
	 o Add new option for specifying sort criteria for piecharts and
	   barcharts.
	 o The report title should change when the report name field is
	   changed in the options.
	 o Add a smart function for going "back" from the "load a file" page.
	   If there are any files loaded it returns to the "loaded files" page
	   instead of the initial druid page.
	 o Add support for i18n of price source strings.
	 o Add icons to gtk only windows.
	 o Search on NOTES add code to prevent searching on template-txn
	   accounts so SXes don't show up in find results.
	 o Create a 'file compression' option and pass the data into the
	   backend. This is an option in the preferences.
	 o Provide a simple checkbook set of accounts
	 o When editing an exchange rate, always change the _VALUE_ of the
	   split, not the amount.  This has the affect of keeping the visible
	   number the same and changing the "other" account.
	 o Add a set of business accounts to the account setup
	 o Give a much higher importance to the date heuristics in the OFX
	   import.
	 o Disable skipping transactions which already have an online id
	   during matching, until a fix for the "transfer between two accounts"
	   bug is properly fixed.
	 o Large set of fixes to the build system by John H. Pierce
	   <john@killterm.org>

 1.7.6  - 22 December 2002
 	 o Welcome to Release Candidate 1
	 o Put the build date into the about box for development versions
	 o Deal with broken QIF files that give broken bang-fields. In
	   particular, handle the case where it supplies "!Type Bank"
	   instead of "!Type:Bank"
	 o Fix g-wrap test to fail properly if it cannot find g-wrap-config
	 o Add "Edit Exchange Rate" menu items to the Actions menu and the
	   context menu
	 o Fix the amount display so that the exchange dialog always shows the
	   "amount" in the the local (register) currency.
	 o Add an additional module to check for (LWP aka libwww-perl)
	   before attempting to call Finance::Quote.
	 o Updated translations, po/nl.po by Hendrik-Jan Heins <hjh@passys.nl>,
	   po/uk.po by Volodymyr M. Lisivka <lvm@mystery.lviv.net>, po/el.po,
	   accounts/el_GR by Nikos Charonitakis <charosn@her.forthnet.gr>

	 o When not retrieving stock quotes for an account, dim the price
	   source labels as well as the option menus.

	   place. Functions to record whether or not F::Q is installed
	   properly, and if so, whether a particular source is available.
	 o Change default new SX frequency to monthly
	 o Filled in a long-thought of idea for a formula cell: can contain
	   text unlike a pricecell, but doesn't really want to do
	   auto-complete like a quickfill cell [what we had been using].  This
	   allows us to provide the gnome formula cell which can remap the
	   keypad '.' character based on locale
	 o Disallow the deletion of accounts with ReadOnly Transaction in
	   them. You must first "delete" the RO Txns before you delete the
	   account.

	   build the documentation if you have doxygen installed.
	 o Catch the condition gracefully when OpenHBCI config file does not
	   exist.
	 o Compute the implicit exchange rates for ALL transactions when

	   a income account -> cash account transaction. Support memorising
	   the income account association. Several stock account can use the
	   same income account if desired.

         o Date bug fix

 1.0.11 - 11 Dec 97
         o large variety of bug fixes, patches, enhancements.

 1.0b1 - 29 Nov 97
         o  Many, many changes by Linas Vepstas to give double entry
            bookkeeping, sub-accounts, income/expense account types, and
            the beginnings of support for the QIF data format.
         o  All "non-standard" libraries needed for xacc (xbae, libhtmlw,
            and libComboBox) are now part of the xacc distribution, to
            make it easier to build xacc.
         o  Applied XbaeMatrixSetCursorPosition patch (needed for quickfill)
            to Linas's modified xbae src.  (So quickfill works again.)
         o  configure script to make it easier to build xacc.
         o  The environment variable XACC_HELP will tell xacc where to
            find the files for the hypertext help.  If XACC_HELP isn't
            set, xacc will default to "./Docs" as the help path.

 0.9 - 08 Sep 97
         o  Lots of code-cleanup.
         o  Adjust Balance window.
         o  Reconcile window!  Makes it easy to reconcile your account
            at the end of the month when you get your new bank statement.
         o  Hypertext, context sensitive help.  A pretty nice add-on,
            thanks to libhtmlw, from NCSA Mosaic.  (Now someone just
            has to write some decent help pages!)
         o  Fixed busy cursor.  Previously the code the switched cursors
            caused the program to crash, so it wasn't enabled.  Now it
            works, and is enabled.

 0.7 - 14 Jul 97
         o  Started adding support for account types other than "BANK".
            Still no support for Portfolio and Mutual accounts.  (They
            are greyed out in the "New Account" window for now.)
         o  Changed the balance field to use red/black text to denote
            negative/positive balance (instead of using a sign... If you
            define USE_NO_COLOR when compiling, it will revert to the
            old method of displaying a '-' in front of negative balances)
         o  Fixed bug in automatic transfers that cause the "From"
            account to always be the first account, and the "To" account
            to possibly be incorrect.  Also, added "[To: ]" "[From: ]"
            (with to account name, and from account name) to the start
            of the memo field, so you can keep track of where the money
            comes from/goes to.

 0.6 - 28 Jun 97
         o  Fixed balance/reconciled field (in bottom right corner
            of register window.  (It sorta works now, with lesstif.
            I don't know about motif... you have to leave the current
            transaction for the balances to be recalculated.)
         o  Rearranged directory structure... the source was growing
            to too many files to have it all in one directory.

 0.5 - 6 Jun 97    Mostly, minor bug fixes
         o  verifyDate  -- affects when accelerator keys in the
            register window cause the date to cross a year boundary
         o  Fixed handling of the date in the transfer window.  Before
            if the user pressed the "transfer" button with an incomplete
            date in the date field, the resulting date would be
            undefined.
         o  If the user doesn't enter data in the description field,
            The number field, the memo field, or one of the amount
            fields, the the new transaction isn't added when the
            user leaves the new transaction, or presses "Record"
         o  Now user is prevented from entering more than one '.'
            in the amount fields in the register and transfer windows.
            Also, the user is prevented from entering more than two
            '/' in the date field in the transfer window.
         o  Fixed a (very small) memory leak in the transfer window.
         o  Fixed a bug in the transfer window that resulted in a
            different amount subtracted from the "from" account as was
            added to the "to" account.
         o  Fixed bug that caused a segfault when deleting the last
            transaction in the register window.
         o  Now if the user is in the last transaction (the empty
            transaction) in the register window, the "Delete" button
            does not do anything.

 0.4 - 3 Jun 97
         o  Added "Balance" and "Reconciled" balance to the bottom
            right corner of the register window.
         o  The main window uses an Xbae-Matrix widget now, instead
            of a list, in order to line up the account names, types,
            and balances in nice columns.

 0.2 - First (mostly) functional release.  Most of the buttons,
       and menu bar choices actually do something now.

 0.1 - First demo release.  Lots of buttons, and menu bar choices
       Don't do anything.  The register window is still pretty
       buggy.
