    <h1>Register Window</h1>
    This is the "Register" or the "Ledger" window. Enter
    transactions here. Add more documentation to this page. 

    <p> This is what the register window should look like:</p>

    <h2>Reconciliation</h2>
    At the bottom of the account window, there are two running
    balances, the "cleared &amp; reconciled" balance, and the
    "total" balance... the "cleared &amp; reconciled" balance
    should correspond to how much money the bank thinks you have in
    your account, and the "total" balance includes outstanding
    transactions. 

    <p> Reconciliation can be done in the <a href=
    "xacc-recnwin.html">Reconcile Window</a></p>

    <p>(Not yet implemented) Transactions marked with <tt> y</tt>
    can not be edited without first changing this flag. This is
    because a reconciled transaction should be thought of as
    something that has been checked over, and therefore correct.
    Changing such a transaction should be difficult: we want to
    avoid accidental errors.</p>

    <p>(Not yet implemented) Transactions marked with <tt>f</tt>
    are frozen, and cannot be edited under any circumstances. These
    have been "frozen" into an accounting period. That is, the
    books have been closed for this period; they may no longer be
    modified.</p>

    <h2>Stock Portfolios</h2>

    <p> You can do stock transaction either from a single-stock
    window, or from a portfolio-view window, shown below.</p>

    <p> The portfolio ledger can be a bit daunting at first sight.
    If you have trouble understanding it, then stick to creating
    accounts which track a single stock. Some important points to
    remember about the portfolio window:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        It shows <em>all</em> stocks in your portfolio, not just
        one. 

        <p> The share amounts shown are for each particular
        stock.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        Note that it uses a two line display. 

        <p> Debited accounts and debited amounts are on the upper
        line, and credited amounts and accounts are on the lower
        line.</p>
      </li>

      <li>If you buy or sell a stock with money from the brokerage
      account, the total balance will not change, since the value
      of the stock equals the amount of money exchanged.</li>

      <li>If you buy or sell a stock with money from the brokerage
      account, the value of the transaction will appear twice, once
      in red, and once in black. If shares are purchased, the
      amount of money debited from the brokerage account will be in
      red, and the value of the shares in black. If shares are
      sold, then value of the shares is in red, and the money
      credited to the brokerage account in black.</li>

      <li>If you are having trouble indicating a share
      purchase/sale in the portfolio ledger, then make sure that
      "Transfer From" and "Transfer To" accounts are in the right
      order. A transfer from a stock account is always interpreted
      as a sale, even if you entered the data as a purchase. The
      vice-versa is also true.</li>

      <li>Eventually, X-Accountant may be enhanced to provide a
      simplified portfolio ledger window.</li>
    </ul>
