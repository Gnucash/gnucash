  <h2>What is Double Entry?</h2>
    Double entry is an accounting methodology used by professionals
    to make sure that all accounts are properly balanced.  When accounts
    balance, the likelihood that a data-entry error has been made is much 
    less.  For large, complex accounts with many transactions, it is easy 
    to make errors that might go undetected for a long time. Double-entry
    is a crucial technology for catching those errors.
    <p>
    A double-entry transaction is a transaction that appears in two 
    accounts.  One account is debited by an amount exactly equal to 
    what the other is credited.  Thus, all transactions are always 
    transfers between two accounts.  Since they always appear with
    a plus sign in one account, and a minus sign in the other, the
    total over all accounts will always be zero, and thus, balanced
    accounts are guaranteed.
    <p>
    Double-entry is already familiar to most people as a transfer 
    from one bank account to another, where money is withdrawn from 
    one and deposited in another.  Far less familiar is the idea that 
    double entry can be used to track income and expenses as well as 
    bank transfers.  See the 
    "<a href="xacc-expense.html">Income/Expense</a>" help window 
    for more information.

  <h2>Using Double Entry</h2>
    To use the double entry, click on a box in the column marked
    "Transfer From" on the left-hand side of the register.  A menu
    will drop down, listing all of the accounts from which a transfer 
    may be made.   Select one.  When you record the transaction,
    the double-entry will automatically be made, and the transaction 
    automatically appear in all windows showing the transfered-from
    and the transferred-to accounts.
    <p>
    To change a double-entry transaction, edit it in any window in 
    which it appears.  Any changes made will be automatically 
    reflected in both accounts and all windows displaying the
    transaction.   Similarly, when a double-entry transaction is 
    deleted, it is deleted from both accounts; balances are
    automatically recalculated for both accounts.
    <p>
    To change the transfer account, simply select a new account 
    from the pull-down menu.  When you record the transaction, 
    it will automatically be selected from the old account, and 
    inserted into the new account.
    
  <h2>Scrubbing Clean</h2>
    GnuCash can be configured to be strict about double entry,
    or to be loose.  In loose mode, you can create unbalanced transactions,
    that is, transactions that don't pair up with a matching entry,
    and thus don't balance to zero.  To clean up these unbalanced transactions,
    you can <b>scrub</b> the account clean by choosing "Scrub" from the 
    window menu.  This will examine each transaction; if the transaction doesn't
    balance, a split entry will be created and placed into an account
    named "Unbalanced".  You can then review these splits and move them
    to thier proper accounts.
