    <h1>Stock Pricing and Ticker Symbols</h1>

    <p> GnuCash currently provides a somewhat rudimentary automated
    stock quote gathering abilities. If an account is properly
    configured, and the host computer is connected to the internet,
    the binary <tt> gnc-prices</tt> may be used to load stock and
    mutual fund price quotes from various web sites directly into
    GnuCash.</p>

    <p> To make use of this facility, the following must be
    done:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Create an account and mark it as being of type "Mutual
      Fund" or "Stock".</li>

      <li>Enter a valid ticker symbol in the box marked
      "Security:"</li>

      <li>Select a quote source from the pull-down menu. Currently
      supported quote sources include <b>Yahoo</b>, <b>Fidelity
      Investments</b>, <b>T. Rowe Price</b> and the <b>Vanguard
      Group</b>. Note that Yahoo will provide price quotes for many
      mutual funds <em>including</em> Fidelity, T.Rowe Price and
      Vanguard, and that the quoted prices/NAV should be identical
      to those on the source sites.</li>
    </ul>

    <p> A sample image is shown below:</p>
    <br>
     <img src="ticker-a.gif"> 

    <p> To update the prices stored in a gnucash account file, run
    the command line command <tt>gnc-price</tt>, specifying the
    filename; for example:</p>
<pre>
    gnc-prices myaccts.xac
</pre>

    <p> Running this command will print various diagnostic messages
    to the screen while it loads data. It will work only when the
    host computer is attached to the internet. It <em> can</em>
    function in conjunction with masquerading-style firewalls, but
    is not currently able to use proxy servers to get through proxy
    or socks-style firewalls.</p>

    <p> The command can be run many times in one day; however, it
    will update the accounts at most once with the most recent
    trading days price data.</p>

    <p> Thus, if <tt>gnc-prices</tt> is run on Friday, Saturday,
    Sunday and Monday, only two price entires will be made: one
    containing Friday's data, and one containing Monday's data,
    since the Saturday and Sunday runs will only retrieve the
    Friday closing price.</p>

    <p>To keep <tt>gnc-prices</tt> from updating one account, while
    allowing it to update another account, merely mark the data
    source for that account as <tt>(none)</tt>. You can do this
    from the <tt>Edit Account</tt> window.</p>

    <p> After running <tt>gnc-prices</tt> for a few days, your
    accounts will begin to resemble the following:</p>
