# This file implements the process of making source distribution tarballs. It expects to find list in
# 'dist_manifest.txt' of all of the files to be included in the distribution, EXCEPT those
# files that are generated. The list of generated files handled via the 'dist_generated' cmake cache variable
#
# Given all of these files, the procedure is to:
# 1. Remove any existing dist directory and make a new one.
# 2. Copy of all the files in dist_manifest.text and ${dist_generated}
#    into the dist directory.
# 3. Create the tarball and compress it with gzip and bzip2.
# 4. Then remove the dist directory.
