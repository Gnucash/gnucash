Hacking Guidelines
==================

This document is an introduction to hacking on GnuCash.

Related Documents
-----------------

In addition to this file, you should read the README file, which
explains the details of getting the CVS source, building GnuCash,
and creating patches for submission.

The src/doc/design directory contains a preliminary design document
which you should read as well. You should also feel free to hack on
the design document.


Coding Style Conventions
------------------------

General:

 * When modifying a file, the style convention in that file should be
   followed.

 * When creating a new file, the style of existing files should be
   followed.

 * When creating lots of new files in a new directory, you may use
   your own coding standards, but please try to stick as closely as
   possible to the GNU coding standards.

 * Do not submit patches that consist of (gratuitous) stylistic changes.


C:

 * Use ISO C.

 * Use glib memory routines where possible. This means you should be
   using g_malloc(), g_new(), g_free(), etc., instead of malloc(),
   free(), etc. Do not mix glib memory calls with libc calls!

 * Where possible, use glib data abstractions instead of rolling your
   own. Glib linked lists and pointer arrays are very convenient and
   have been extensively used and tested.

 * All gnucash functions and global variables are prefixed with gnc_

 * Use static functions whenever possible

 * Use const whenever possible


Scheme:

 * All gnucash functions and global variables are prefixed with gnc:

 * All global variables are enclosed in ** (i.e. gnc:*load-path*)

 * All private functions are enclosed in __ (i.e. gnc:_do-not-call_)

 * All C functions wrapped with g-wrap have dashes in place of underscores.
   (xaccSplitGetBalance --> gnc:split-get-balance).
