This library has taken insight from

OLE:
    - libole : Michael Meeks, Arturo Tena, and Frank Chiulli
	- which was based on
	    Laola : by Martin Schwartz
	    WINE : Marcus Meissner, Francis Beaudet, Sylvain St-Germain and
		    Thuy Nguyen
	    Caolan McNamara's work

    - POIFS : Marc Johnson

VBA:
    - libole : Michael Meeks and Frank Chiulli figuring out quite a bit about
		how a vba stream is stored.
    - OpenOffice : For confirming many of Michael's hypothesis' and supplying
		insight into the project file structure.
    - Costin Raiu, Kaspersky Labs <craiu@pcnet.ro>
	: For commenting that the dir stream had offsets too.  That way we can
	   avoid OpenOffice's trouble parsing pcode.

gzip:
    - zlib : for doing all the heavy lifting, and suppling gzio.c as an
		example.
