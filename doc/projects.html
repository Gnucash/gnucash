    <h1>GnuCash Project Goals</h1>

    <p>
    The people behind <a href="http://www.gnucash.org">GnuCash</a>
    aim to create a world-class GPL'ed Open Source Personal
    Financial Application for GNU/Linux and other Unix's. This page
    reviews some of the technical issues and development status
    surrounding this project. It is a kind of an <b>FAQ</b> for
    developers and contributors, providing status, and suggesting
    directions and technologies for deploying new features. If you
    simply want to get a better idea of what <a href=
    "http://www.gnucash.org">GnuCash</a> is and what it does, visit its
    <a href="http://www.gnucash.org">home page</a>. The home page
    contains screen shots, news items, and mailing list
    archives.
    </p>

    <p>
    There are currently several different versions of GnuCash.
    We've adopted the kernel numbering scheme: even minor release
    numbers (1.4.x, 1.6.x) are considered to mark stable releases,
    while odd numbers (1.5.x, 1.7.x) mark development releases.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>The current stable, production release is gnucash-1.6.0 and
          is based on the <a href= "http://www.gnome.org">Gnome</a> / 
          <a href= "http://www.gtk.org">GTK</a> libraries.
      </li>

      <li>The 1.7.x releases focus on adding new features and
          improving existing functionality.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    The latest version is available only via CVS.  Occasionally,
    some of the more stable CVS versions are given a version number,
    and packaged as a precompiled deb or RPM install package. Naive or
    beginning users should probably stick to version gnucash-1.6.0.
    More adventurous users can try one of the 1.7.x releases, However,
    keep in mind that they are in a state of constant change and will
    often be unstable.

    <h1>Architectural Goals</h1>
    </a> 
    There are some over-reaching design principles and philosophies
    that we intend to maintain. Some of these concepts and terms
    are introduced in this section. 

    <h2>Separation of GUI and Data</h2>
    First, we must maintain a clean separation between the data
    structures and the GUI that manipulates them, along the lines
    of the <b>Model-View-Controller</b> paradigm. 

    <ul>
      <li>Lists of accounts and the transactions in them can be
          thought of as a representation of financial data, a 
          <b>Model</b>.
	  </li>

      <li>The GUI that adds, modifies and deletes these should be
          thought of as a manipulator of the data, a <b>Controller</b>.
          Thus, the Motif or Gnome GUI's are merely two possible
          manipulators of the data; others, based on <i>e.g.</i>
          web/cgi-bin, Qt/KDE, emacs, Java applets or Java servlets
          ought to be possible.</li>

      <li>The <b>View</b> of the data is a subset or slice of the
          data described by the Model. The View may consist of only the
          transactions for the month of May, or only the account totals
          for certain accounts. The View is used in part to generate
          the reports and graphs, but it is also that which the
          Controller interacts with. Views are generated by queries to
          the data store.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    GnuCash also needs to deal with multiple distributed data
    sources: stock quotations from the net or transaction
    confirmations from online banks and brokerage houses, or from
    more mundane sources, such as file imports, or merger of data
    from several users. Amongst these terms, the concept of a
    global Model-View is dated, and somewhat inappropriate. Rather,
    we need to be concerned about how data is represented in the
    local address space of the GUI, how the GUI manipulates it, how
    data is brought in and merged from external sources, and how
    that data is again output, whether to a file or a local or
    remote database.</p>

    <p>
    Thus, the <b>View</b> essentially represents a local data
    cache of the data that is immediately present and being
    displayed, reported, and manipulated. The <b>Model</b> is the
    abstraction of that data that the GUI (the controller) can act
    on.</p>

    <h2>The Financial Engine</h2>
    In GnuCash, the Model is implemented via the <b>Engine</b> API,
    and the View is the data that is currently in the <b>
    Engine</b>. Thus, the Engine is a set of programming API's that
    the GUI (or a script, or even a clever command-line-addict) can
    use to manipulate the data. 

    <p>
    Currently, the Engine provides basic accounting structures
    These include: </p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Transactions</b>, which consist of a set of 'splits'
      or journal entries (JE's) whose values sum to zero.
      The transaction includes several date fields, a description,
      and a common-currency field, and a universal unique id 
      (uuid/guid).  It also provides hooks to store arbitrary data 
      associated with the transaction (using a URL-based key-value tree).
      </li>

      <li><b>Journal Entries</b> (internally referred to as
      'splits') which an amount and the account on which it is drawn.
      Splits also store reconcile status, dates, a memo field, 
      and also a key-value based hook for arbitrary data.
      </li>

      <li><b>Accounts</b>, which include a nme, a type, a description
      field, and the type of commodity they store.  Principlally,
      the account consists of a list of journal entries.</li>

      <li><b>Chart of Accounts</b>, which is a hierarchical tree of
      accounts.</li>
    </ul>

    The Engine has a basic two-phase commit model, and a 
    query mechanism for finding the data needed for reports and 
    views. The goal of the two-phase commit and query model is 
    allow the creation of multi-user server based backends, such
    as an SQL backend, and RPC client-server backend, or an 
    XML-based HTTP/web backend.  This design seems to work 
    for the above-named backends.
    
    <p>The Engine currently handles only a basic set of data
    sources:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>It can import and merge in QIF's (actually, this function
          has been moved into the GUI, and is no longer part of the 
	  engine);
	  </li>

      <li>It can read and write its own XML byte stream;
          This ability has been used to provide a multi-user
	  client-server demo (which is currently broken).
          </li>

      <li>It can use a Postgres SQL database as a datastore, thereby
          enabling multi-user and auditing functions.
	  </li>

      <li>It can talk, via RPC, to a gnucash server.  (This code is 
          'alpha' and incomplete/broken).
	  </li>
	  
      <li>It can get stock quotes from the net (actually, this 
          function is provided by a separate module, the Finance::Quote
	  perl module.)
	  </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    However, since the Engine is meant to be the interface
    between the GUI and the financial data, it is really intended
    to be able to do much more.
    In particular, it should be possible to create a peer-to-peer
    network model, where gnucash peers can synchronize data between
    themselves.  The engine should also be expandable to handle other 
    sources of data, such as OFX/IFX, the Open Trading Protocol, or 
    the OMG CORBA General Ledger submission.  In particular, it
    should be possible to use GnuCash not only to view data from
    these sources, but also to manipulate it and send it back.
    </p>

    <h2>Modularity, Extensibility and Customization</h2>

    <p>The above structure should lead us to view GnuCash not so
    much as a tightly integrated application, but rather as a loose
    confederation of component objects, libraries and interfaces.
    This has a number of advantages for both the deeloper and the 
    user.  For the developer, it allows parts to evolve semi-independently
    of one-another, and to be used in other, non-gnucash projects.
    For the user, a good extensibility allows the use of
    <a href="#arrangements">arrangements</a>: a way of broadly
    customizing the appearance and behaviour of gnucash, and then 
    allowing users to very easily share these customizations with 
    one another.  Such arrangements might be collections of canned 
    reports, e.g. for business or home user.  Or they might be
    the menu contents: one menu arrangement is for gbeginners, another 
    for 'power users', a third for business owners.  Th goal is that
    broad areas should be not only customizable, but it should be
    possible, even easy, to trade these customizations between users.
    </p>
    <p>
    In order to facilitate the gluing together of these parts, as
    well as simplify the questions of customizability, change and
    rapid development, GnuCash makes use of the 
    <a href= "http://www.swiss.ai.mit.edu/projects/scheme/index.html">
    Scheme</a> extension language (as implemented in the FSF 
    <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/guile.html">Guile</a>
    interpreter), to glue the pieces together. (Note that the
    engine interface is also available with 
    <a href="http://www.perl.org">Perl</a> interfaces, thanks to a 
    <a href="http://starship.skyport.net/crew/beazley/swig.html">SWIG</a>
    wrapper.
    </p>

    <h2>A Web Browser for Financial Data</h2>

    <p>More and more finacial data is moving onto the web.  
    People shop on-line. They pay bills on-line.  There are
    even some promising e-wallet systems (such as 
    <a href="http://www.webfunds.org">WebFunds</a>).  For GnuCash
    to be relevant in this on-line world, it must be able to interact
    with these systems.  There are several steps that can be taken
    along this path.  First, it must be possible to simply and
    transparently import financial data off the web.   Click on a QIF
    file, mime-type "application/x-qif"? Gnucash sucks it in without 
    burping.  But, in a more distant future, can GnuCash originate
    transactions? It should be able to!  
    </p>
    <p>
    GnuCash can be and should be "The Sophisticated Financial Web Browser".
    All GnuCash reports and the help system are HTML-based.  In fact,
    GnuCash has a built-in web browser that can view ordinary web sites.
    Interactive gnucash components such as the bar and pie charts, or
    the graphs and reports, can all be served up by a remote web server,
    as well as locally through the GnuCash application.  This allows
    GnuCash to blur the line between web browser and financial application,
    and offer the best of both worlds.
    </p>
    <p>
    Why is this a good thing?  One can always have a pure web-based
    accounting solution (such as SQL-Ledger) that uses ordinary web
    browsers to view the financial data. But there are problems:
    dynamically-generated html and cgi-bins aren't as pretty or easy 
    to use, or as fast, responsive or sophisticated, as what you can 
    do with a custom client.   That is, GnuCash can be more interactive,
    easier to user, slicker and more professional looking in style 
    and presentation than a plain-old dynamic website.  Financial
    ASP's simply cannot currently offer the kind of utility, flexibility,
    responsiveness and integration that GnuCash can offer.
    </p>
    <p>
    In theory, the 'Java revolution' was supposed to provide this 
    function, with downloadable Java applets providing the 'fancier-
    than-plain-html' interface.  But a Java applet that is this 
    sophisticated would also be large and slow to download:
    it offers no inherent advantages over native code.  Another 
    problem with Java is the inherent propreitary fragmentation: 
    no two Java applets are alike: every site has their own; there
    is no standardization. 
    </p>
    <p>
    In order to solve the 'no gui standardization between websites'
    problem, there are a number of businesses that have arisen to 
    provide "financial aggregation".  You sign up with these sites,
    and let them get all of your credit-card, bank and investment info,
    and they can provide a unified interface for your bank statements,
    with graphs and reports (all for a monthly fee).  The existence of
    these services highlights a problem: the inability to aggregate
    the same data on the users desktop, in a simple, coherent fashion.
    Let us posit that GnuCash, with the right on-line interfaces, 
    would be a natural for this.  For the paranoid,
    this has the added advantage that no one business has access to
    all of your financial records.
    </p>

    <p>
    To put it another way, GnuCash can provide a centralized, trusted 
    store for financial data that no other application can provide.  
    The convenience 
    factor:  if you have trading accounts at e*trade and charles schwab,
    then GnuCash can be the central place where you can oversee 
    <b>all</b> of your investments.  The trust factor:  
    maybe you can trust your web bank. Maybe you can trust your web 
    stock account.  But can you trust a single web entity with *all*
    of your financial data?  Someone who won't treat you as 'just 
    another consumer' and sell your 'consumer profile' to anyone who
    cares to stalk (ahem, target) your financial activity (ahem,
    purchasing) patterns?  Didn't think so.   Of course, you
    *could* use some proprietary financial software.  Assuming, of course,
    that you trust it not to have any built-in covert channels:
    nothing that might send back the make and model of your CPU and 
    the last ten transactions 'home to mommy' for 'diagnostic purposes'.
    Because open source software, such as GnuCash, can be audited
    it can be trusted in ways that no proprietary software can be.
    In an increasingly net-connected world, the ability to build 
    trust through audits will be increasingly important.
    </p>

    <h2>Looking Into the Future</h2>
    Things like support for OFX, and small-business features are
    hopefully in the near term future of gnucash.  Lets take a look
    at some more far-out possibilities.
    </p>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>E-Wallet</b></dt>
    <dd>An e-wallet, just like a real wallet, stores cash.  You
        can use that cash to pay freinds or businesses.  Just
	like a real wallet, an e-wallet should not charge you 
	monthly fees.  It should provide you with some measure
	of anonymity and privacy.  An e-wallet should also do 
	something no ordinary wallet can do: show you a monthly
	report of expenditures.  GnuCash should get e-wallet 
	features. </dd>

   <dt><b>Authentication, Authorization and Access Control</b></dt>
   <dd>How does an on-line merchant know that you are who you say
       you are?  How can you use GnuCash to authorize a bill payment?
       Sooner or later, smart-cards will provide the sort of 
       authentication and access control that is only groped for 
       with PGP/GPG, keyrings, x.509 certificates, and Microsoft 
       Passport/Hailstorm.   Of all the electronic things in the
       electronic world where access control and authentication
       are important, real money is the most so.  
       </dd>

    <dt><b>Bill Presentment, Bill Pay</b></dt>
    <dd>These magic keywords just mean that a merchant wants to 
        send you a bill, and wants you to go to their website to
	pay that bill (they want your eyeballs).  Of course, for
	the user, it would be more convenient to have the bill
	show up on the desktop, inside of gnucash, and get authenticated
	and paid out from the desktop (by gnucash), as you would
	do with all of your other bills.
    </dl>

    <!--===================================================-->

    <a name="reqs">
    <h1>Requirements</h1>
    </a>
    Lets take a look at who the current and potential future users
    of GnuCash are, and how they might use it.   The classes:

    <ul>
      <li>Basic Household Accounting/Budgeting</li>
      <li>Personal Stock Portfolio Management</li>
      <li>Personal On-line Trading (Day-Trading)</li>
      <li>On-line shopping and bill-pay</li>
      <li>Small Business Users</li>
    </ul>
    These different applications may use some of the same 
    financial terminology, and hopefully might share a fair 
    bit of code, but have quite different goals and requirements. 

    <h3>Basic Household Accounting and Budgeting</h3>

    <p>Important properties of a personal finance system
    include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Approachable and usable by occasional users
          who are not knowledgeable about accounting.</li>

      <li>Ease of use and simplicity is critical.</li>

      <li>A reasonable selection of reports, graphs, charts, and
          tools for personal finance, such as mortgage
          calculations.</li>

      <li>Budgeting support needs to be targeted at <em>naive</em>
          users.</li>

      <li>Interfaces to on-line banking, shopping, stock
          systems.  Bank and credit-card statements should
          arrive 'automatically' and always be up-to-date.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Personal Portfolio Management</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Support for management of stock portfolios that may
          involve considerable sophistication, since individuals
          commonly have retirement plans that hold mutual funds,
          stocks, options, bonds, and the like.</li>
      <li>Reporting infrastructure needs to simplify handling of
          tax issues (long-term vs. short-term capital gains/losses,
	  cost-basis FIFO accounting, simplfied cost-basis 
	  spinoff/merger handling).  Need on-line updates of
	  prices, simple portfolio overview, ability to link
	  to websites for additional research.
      <li>Integration with on-line trading systems.  This could 
          save time typing.
      <li>Basic Audit features.  There's a problem with blindly
          allowing on-line data (prices, transactions) to enter
	  GnuCash.  It may not be clear where it came from,
	  and even if the source is beleived to be 'reputable',
	  there still may be factual errors in the data.  Thus,
	  there must be a way of audting newly-arrived (or even old)
	  on-line data, and mark it as 'reconciled', i.e. 
	  manually reviewed and checked for accuracy.  That is,
	  incoming on-line data must be auditable, and audit
	  trails should mark the history of on-line data import.
    </ul>

    <h3>Small Business Needs</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>With a business system, it is likely that there will be
          users who use it eight hours a day, which puts the emphasis 
	  on <em>efficiency</em> of user interface rather than on its
          approachability to naive users.</li>

      <li>Business systems require network support, and the ability
          to support multiple simultaneous users.</li>

      <li>Some business users may want access to the system from an
          MS Windows 95/98/NT box. For these folks, a web-based
          interface could be just handy. Web interfaces are also nice
          a for ASP type deployment.</li>

      <li>
        Small businesses do not often have sophisticated investment
        portfolios; they instead need support for additional
        sophistication in such areas as: 

        <ul>
	  <li>Customer and Vendor Lists; Invoicing</li>
	  
          <li>Payroll (Batch processed and individual)</li>

          <li>Inventory Control &amp; Asset Management</li>
          <li>Amortization Schedules, Depreciation</li>

          <li>Shipping and Receiving</li>

          <li>Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable (A/R, A/P)</li>
          <li>Credit Card Processing</li>

        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>Support for calculations associated with accrual
          accounting.</li>

      <li>Ambitions for the future might include interfaces to
          online shopping carts, credit card clearing interfaces, and
          ERP systems.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Reconciling Those Needs</h3>

    <p>A seemingly contradictory factor is that the kinds of
    sophistication that are required vary considerably.
    Consider:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>A home user does not generally require most of the
      sophistication of accrual accounting that is
      required by business enterprises. Thus, home users don't need
      <em>much</em> of the sophistication of an Accounts Receivable
      or Payable system, or the <em>bizarre</em> depreciation
      policies that crop up in Asset Management systems.<br>
      <br>
      </li>

      <li>
        On the other hand, home users are in increasing need of
        surprisingly sophisticated financial tools for managing
        stock portfolios, including: 

        <ul>
          <li>Mutual funds</li>

          <li>Retirement savings plans, with such identifiers as
          401(k), IRA, Roth IRA, RRSP, or Insurance Annuities</li>

          <li>Corporate stock purchase plans</li>

          <li>Corporate option plans</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    Another set of contradictory requirements has to do with the
    back-end, and interfacing to other systems: 

    <ul>
      <li>Home users need a simple-to-install, simple-to-maintain
      system. This essentially rules out the use of SQL for the
      storage medium/back-end for home users. (That is, the current
      state of the art for SQL on Linux does not offer any simple,
      fool-proof management for data).</li>

      <li>By contrast, non-SQL systems for business use are almost
      unimaginable. SQL provides a high degree of data integrity
      and storage robustness, and also simplifies tremendously the
      import and export of data. Powerful SQL tools exist that can
      work magic in the hands of a good DB admin.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>It may be that these will require <em>completely</em>
    different systems, and that GnuCash cannot be "all things to
    all people." This remains to be seen.</p>

    <h1>Features and Functions</h1>
    </a>
    This section reviews the current status of various features.
    Some of these are 'in process', some are 'almost done', some
    are 'completely done'. This section thus provides status on
    both where we've been, and where we're going. 

    <dl>

      <dt><a name="i18n"><b>Internationalization</b></a></dt>

      <dd>
        All menus, markup and help-text should be
        internationalized, so that GnuCash may be usable in any
        country. This would include the printing of currency values
        in the local country conventions. 

        <p><b>Current status:</b>
        Essentially Done (?)
        <ul>
          <li>All GUI messages currently use GNU <tt>gettext()</tt>
          for the message catalogs. Translations exist for English,
          British, French, Swedish, German, Japanese.</li>

          <li>Help pages available only in English and French.</li>

          <li>Monetary and string handling done through glibc. The
          latest glibc (2.2.3) is needed to get the correct
          functions.</li>

          <li>Yannick Le Ny &lt;y-le-ny@ifrance.com&gt; traduction
          en francais</li>

          <li>Most GUI input elements use the gtk text widget, and
          thus use the XIM input method in Asian locales. This
          allows <i>e.g.</i> Kanji, Katakana support. However, the
          register does <em>not</em> use XIM, and thus doesn't
          currently support the Asian languages. This needs
          fixing. (This may be done already??)</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
      </dd>

      <dt><a name="reports"><b>Reports</b></a></dt>

      <dd>
        A variety of reports, including Net Worth, Balance Sheets,
        and Profit and Loss statements. These should be printable:
        that is, exportable as HTML as well as print-ready
        postscript. These should be easy to customize. Ideally,
        even novice users should be able to create custom reports. 

        <p>The Report Generator should be a separate but "dockable"
        subsystem of the whole. That is, it should be possible to
        run the report generator in a stand-alone, read-only
        fashion without having to start up the main application. It
        should be possible to run reports nightly from a
        command-line and/or cron job.
	The GUI should remember what reports were run last time, and
	these should be re-run/redisplayed whenever the report generator
	is used.
	</p>

        <p>One difficult aspect of reporting is designing a
        configurable interface, so that people can build custom
        reports. The <a href="xacc-reports.html#NEWREP">New
        Reporting Infrastructure</a> is seeking to build this up
        using Guile.   Note there are several flavours of customization:
        <ul>
        <li>Allow user to specify a custom logo (e.g. company 
	    logo/address) on every page
            (generically, having a header and footer for every page).
        <li>Allowing user to modify report title/subtitle on the fly
            (and possibly add notes at the top or bottom of the report,
            e.g. to explain line items).
        <li>Allow user to use the <a href="#query">transaction query</a>
            interface to pick the set of transactions that will make up
            the report.
        <li>Memorize the report that was asked for, give that report
            a name, and in the future, allow that same exact report 
            to be re-run.  Allow user to edit this report properties
            at a later date.  Note that the basic idea is similar to 
            that of <a href="#query">memorized queries, discussed below.</a>
        </ul>
        Note that the customization info should be stored in a 
        <a href="#arrangements">Arrangements File (see below)</a>.
        </p>

        <p>Generated reports should be exportable to other gnome
        systems (probably using bonobo). 
        Reports should also be exportable to
        the Gnumeric spreadsheet (probably by writing out gnumeric
        file format).  Export of CSV (comma separated values) and
	tab-delimited formats (for other spreadsheet import) would
	be good.  Tables & etc. should be exportable to AbiWord,
        StarOffice, other word processors. (formats: docbook sgml?
        would then make convert to richtext, TeX easy.)
	Export should be as wysiwyg as possible.
        </p>

        <p>Must be possible to e-mail reports (for example,
	invoices) to users.  Suggest an evolution addressbok
	/mailer bonobo plugin.
        </p>

        <p>
        Relationship to budgeting not clear ... 
        </p>

        <p>Stock portfolio tools should include a Cost Averaging
        report, Market Index report, Stock Option values,
        Estimation of capital gains tax liabilities.</p>

        <p>Reports should be printable to printer (postscript/
	Adobe Acrobat). 

        <p>
        <b>Status:</b>

        <ul>
          <li>A general reporting infrastructure was implemented in
              Perl, in the form of html-embedded perl (ePerl). However,
              this reporting mechanism was abandoned in part because
              ongoing build and install problems related to ePerl and
              swig. Also, since ePerl didn't participate in the
              interpreter even loop, the report generator had to run
              as a separate process, reading data via pipes. This was
              uglier than some folks liked.</li>

          <li>A general reporting infrastructure has been <a href=
              "xacc-reports.html#NEWREP">implemented in Scheme</a>.
              Currently, there are a variety of reports for Profit/Loss,
              Balance Sheet, and portfolio valuation; none are 
	      particularly sophisticated.</li>

          <li>Done: Reports are displayed with the gtk-html widget.
	      This widget provides postscript printing and Acrobat 
	      output.
              </li>

          <li>There is currently no way (no longer any way??) to
              generate reports from the command line ...</li>

          <li>While many reports have been implemented, there is
	      no master list of what we should have.  We should have ....
          </li>

          <li>The following technologies were rejected/unused mostly
              because they were too complex, didn't hang together technologies:
              <a href= "http://www.oasis-open.org/cover/">SGML</a> and <a href=
              "http://www.oasis-open.org/cover/xml.html">Extensible
              Markup Language - XML.</a> In the long run, these are
              preferable to HTML, since <a href=
              "http://www.jclark.com/dsssl/">DSSSL</a> tools such as <a
              href="http://www.jclark.com/jade/">Jade (James DSSSL
              Engine)</a> can be used to convert to RTF, Postscript, etc.
              Add to this the consideration that XML is the basis for the
              <a href="http://www.w3.org/DOM/">Document Object Model</a>,
              which is being integrated into many web-based applications,
              and we can see that XML is an increasingly significant
              format as we look to the future.
        </li>

        </ul>
        </p>
      </dd>

      <dt><a name="graphs"><b>Graphs</b></a></dt>

      <dd>
        <p>Provide support for graphs, charts, etc., such as:
           Asset allocation pie chart, portfolio value vs. cost,
           ROI.  Graphs should be printable to printer.
           Graph generation should be fully integrated with reporting,
           both for data collection via queries, and for displayed
           output.
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>Status:</b>
        <ul>
          <li>Different graphing packages were evaluated, 
              <a href="http://www.gnome.org/guppi/">GUPPI</a>.
              Guppi was chosen.  Considered & rejected were
              plotutils, gnumeric graphing code (Miguel says 
              they'll replace gnumeric code with guppi.)
              Miguel's/Gnumeric requirements were:
              interactive plot editing -- each segment attributes 
              totally settable/controllable -- drag/move callbacks 
              when segments are click-dragged.
          </li>
	  <li>Basic pie charts and bar charts are used in GnuCash
	      reports.  There are problems: dates along the bottom
	      of a bar-chart are not well-spaced/autoscaled. 
	      The over look is a bit klunky.
        </ul>
        </p>
      </dd>

      <dt><a name="query"><b>Transaction Query</b></a></dt>

      <dd>
        Allow user to build (complex) queries to locate a 
        set of transactions that match some criteria: e.g.
        a date range, or a matching payee, description, amount,
        etc.  Once a user has created a complex query, it
        must be possible to memorize it (i.e. give it a name,
        and store it for future reuse).

        <p>
        <b>Status:</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>The query engine has been implemented (as of 1.4.0,
              grib)
          </li>
          <li>The GUI for creating queries has been implemented
              (as of 1.4.0, grib)
          </li>
          <li>The queries are handled by the Postgres SQL backend.
	      (as of 1.6.0, linas)
          </li>
	  <li>Queries can be turned into XML and back, for file 
	      storage or network transmission.  This used to work
	      for XML version 1 but was broken in version 2.
          </li>
          <li>The ability to memorize queries has <b>not</b>
              been implemented and awaits further action (needed
	      for reports, above).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </dd>

      <dt><a name="ledger"><b>Simplified Ledger</b></a></dt>

      <dd>
        Ledger should look clean, work easily.

        <p>
        <b>Status:</b></p>
	Essentially done.
        <ul>
	   <li>Multi-line ledger confusion fixed by using correct 
	       left-right journal display style.
	       Fixed in 1.6.0, Peticolas, Champaigne.
	   </li>
	   <li>
               Stocks and Mutual funds are handled by placing them each in
               their own account. Each account can be viewed individually.
               If all of the stock accounts are children of a master
               trading account, then the trading account can be viewed and
               modified in a General Ledger window. 
	       Layout problems fixed in 1.6.0.
	   </li>
	   <li>
              How to most simply allow the user to enter loads and fees?
              Through multi-line transactions. Seems to work well in
	      1.6.0.
	   </li>
        </ul>
      </dd>

      <dt><a name="glitz"><b>Themes, Icons, Glitz</b></a></dt>

            (do you own a house? appraised value? mortgage?

            In particular, show how appreciation
            and depreciation should be treated.

            accounts.
	    This is mostly solved by having the MDI interface 
	    have reports, and the use of multi-paning.  But the
	    default display for gnucash should be changed to 
	    show a very small (1-4 line) networth and P&L report,
	    and maybe a cash-flow report.

            Currently, when each new register opens, it opens in a

            register window in a bigger frame, and just have
            'backward/forward' buttons to navigate through
            different registers (the way that a browser navigates
            web pages.) This of course would be a user
            preference.  Possibility for doing this exists with MDI.

      <dd>
        Ability to close the book at end of the fiscal year. This
        consists of several steps: 

        <ul>
          <li>Permanently lock some transactions as non-editable.
              This should be straight-forward by using the <tt>
              reconciled</tt> field to indicate a <tt>locked</tt>
              value, and not allowing the GUI to edit locked
              records.
          </li>
          <li>Transfer the Income minus Expense for the book period
              to an equity account, so that each new period starts with
              zero income/expense balances.
          </li>
          <li>A mechanism to purge really old transactions from the
              database.
          </li>
          <li>Extensions to querying and reporting infrastructure ...
              The query changes might be painful ...
          </li>
          <li>
              A user should be allowed to 'delete' an account <em>
              only</em> if it has no transactions in the currently
              open book. 
              Of course, it's not deleted from the old books.
              From this last, we conclude that every chart of
              accounts should have a beginning and ending date (that
              match the book period), and the file format needs to
              support multiple charts ...
          </li>
          <li>Memorized Transactions ... Currently, transaction
              auto-completion works by auto-completing with the last 
              'similar' transaction.  This ability will get trashed 
              when books for the old year get closed, because there 
              won't be 'similar' transactions.

      <dt><a name="arrangements"><b>Arrangments</b></a></dt>

      <dd>
        An "application arrangement" is the defining look-n-feel of an application.
        The idea is similar to, but not the same as 'skins'/'themes'.  Its similar
        to, but not the same as allowing a user to set 'preferences'.  Its similar 
        to, but not the same as, allowing a user to generate customized financial 
        reports.  In the context of GnuCash, a 'arrangement' should be a file
        (that can be traded by users, uploaded and shared) that controls important
        aspects of how the application is configured.
        <p>
        In particular, the GnuCash Arrangement should include the following:
        <ul>
        <li>A list of sample/initial accounts.  These might be tailored for a 
            home user (groceries, gas, electric), an apartment dweller 
            (rent, laundry), or different kinds of business users.
            Because these sample accounts appear in the Arrangement file, 
            it becomes easy to create & distribute customized arrangements.
        <li>A list of pre-defined reports and graphs.  The kind that you'd find
            for a home user might be different than for a person managing a stock
            portfolio, which is in turn different from what a business might need.
            The Arrangement File should include install-specific customizations, such 
            as the report headers, footers, etc.
        <li>Hint of the day.  The types of 'hint of the day' would be different 
            for new users, than it would be for advanced users.  Thus, different
            arrangements would have different catalogues of 'hint of the day'.
        <li>Menu Contents & Navigation.  New users might be presented with a simple set
            of menu contents.  'Power Users' might be presented with deep, nested
            sets of menus, with oodles of features.
        <li>Register Layout.  The layout of the register might be customized for
            different countries: e.g. in Germany, a different type of electronic
            banking seems to require the display of account numbers in separate
            columns in the register.
        </ul>
        A good arrangement infrastructure will not only allow gnucash to be configured
        for different application domains, but also will allow users to fine-tune
        their own preferred arrangement.   It can also simplify the code base: 
        instead of having two products, a home-user application, and a small-business 
        application, each with a different code base and #defines and what not, instead,
        we have one code base, and different arrangments for each.
        However, most importantly, the arrangments should be easy to share between users.
        They should be such that users are encouraged to trade and use arrangments,
        and to create new ones that suit their needs.
        </p>
        <p>
        The idea for arrangements was inspired by 
        Adam Curry's commentary on
        <a href="http://adamcurry.editthispage.com/stories/storyReader$161">
        radio formats and Napster</a>.

      <dd>
        A dialog system and file format for manipulating user
        preferences. Preferences include things like default
        currency, register layout and colors, etc. 

        <p>What are some of the competitive preference-handling
        technologies? Lets get some URL's here ... Following the
        Unix tradition, there is no global preferences registry.
        Note that session management and preferences are related
        things ... sort-of. Right now, we don't treat them as such
        ...</p>

        <p><b>Status:</b></p>
	Done, more or less, version 1.6.0.

        <ul>
          <li>Works real good; lots of preferences in the GUI.
              Implemented in home-grown scheme. (version 1.4.0,
	      rlb)</li>

          <li>These are saved in the '.gnucash/config.auto' file.
              The current file format is raw scheme code, rather
              delicate to tweak by hand ...</li>
	  
          <li>Session management mostly works, but doesn't use the 
	      sawmill/gnome/X ICCCM system.  GnuCash remembers MDI
	      based reports, restart reopens in same state. Sizes
	      and shapes and positions are remembered.
	      Done in version 1.6.0
              </li>

          <li>Independently of session management, the register
              windows should remember how big they were last time they
              were popped up, and they should pop up the same size, again.
              The app should remember these sizes from invocation to
              invocation. Done in version 1.6.0, but seems a bit buggy.

      <dd>
        The application is wired together partly with C, partly
        with Scheme. The architecture of the wiring and how scheme
        is fit in needs to be reviewed, with a general overview
        created so that additional extensions may be added in a
        straightforward manner. 

        <p>The overall architecture is envisioned thus:
        All code, including the transaction engine, the file I/O
        routines, the menus, and the ledger, will be abstracted
        into compact modules that can function independently of
        each other. At the highest level, there will be a
        infrastructure with extension language interfaces that will
        "wire together" the various modules.</p>

        <p>Such "wiring together" will consist of a dispatch
        infrastructure that will allow arbitrary menu entries to be
        hooked to arbitrary modules. The configuration for menu
        entries, and their associated callbacks, will be specified
        in an extension-language configuration file. At the final
        stages, it is <em>highly</em> desirable to be able to, in
        some manner, import new modules <em>without</em> requiring
        that the application itself be recompiled and relinked.</p>

        salary checks, regular gas/phone/electric bills, <em>
        etc.</em> 

        <p>(2) Recurring bills, salary income, etc. are simpler to
        handle, since they don't have interest rates, balloons,
        etc. They do/will have multiple splits (<em>e.g.</em>
        payroll gross, fica, futa, income taxes, payroll net).</p>

        <p>(3)Provide list of upcoming &amp; recently paid
        bills/scheduled payments/scheduled deposits for the next
        1,2,3,6,12 months. Historical view shows payments crossed
        out (!?)</p>

        <p>(4)Loans &amp; mortgages are one of the more complicated
        recurring transactions.  Typically, there might be a years
        worth of smaller payments, then a long string of larger
        payments, followed by a balloon.
        </p>
         
        <p>(5)Provide a calendar-display of upcoming &amp; past
        scheduled payments. Clicking on a calendar day should raise
        up editable list of transactions. Calendaring should
        include generic red-lettering of important dates: taxes
        due, insurance renewal dates, domain registration renewal
        dates, ISP contract expiration date :-). These may or may
        not be associated with transactions. Memo's should be
        possible. Pop-ups should happen when dates get close.

	component.</p>

        <p><b>Design Notes:</b> Most alerts &amp; data storage
        should be driven out of the engine. This will enable

        piggy-backed on a general alert infrastructure within the
        engine, viz, registered callbacks when balances change, so
        that windows can be redrawn. Not clear on if/how calendar
        events might be server-ified. (On the other hand, a good
        calendar should be server-ified, and thus viewable by
        secretaries, co-workers, etc.)</p>

      <dd>
        The system supports double-entry: every transaction
        indicates a pair of accounts: one is debited, and one is
        credited. 

        <p>Double-entry is a powerful way of ensuring the integrity
        of of the financial data. Currently, while double-entry is
        supported, its use is not enforced: the user <em>can</em>
        create dangling transactions, where only one account is
        indicated.</p>

        <p>Although this is acceptable for home use (arguably
        desirable, since it allows the casual user the simplicity
        they desire), it is not acceptable for business use. (The
        counterargument is that casual users that aren't
        accountants need all the help at getting things right that
        they can get.)</p>

        <p>It must be possible to enforce double entry, so that a
        transaction cannot be completed until two accounts have
        been specified.</p>

        <p><b>Restricted Double</b> Note that sometimes, the words
        'single-entry' have a an alternate meaning: they can mean
        'a double entry account which can only be credited, or
        debited, but not both'. We need to implement this.</p>

        <p><b>Current status:</b>

        <ul>
          <li>April 1998 -- The engine has a couple of flags in it
          that control double-entry behavior: it can be made lax or

          way to change them from the GUI.</li>

          <li>Dec 1998 -- Scrubber functions implemented to crawl
          through data, and find all unbalanced or orphaned
          transactions.</li>

        references. 

        <p>OFX is an open spec from Microsoft, Intuit, and
        Checkfree, and which will be supported by Integrion. The
        OFX DTD's are included in the 1.1 distributions. See <a
        href="http://www.ofx.net">OFX Home Page</a> for
        details.</p>

        <p>There are two ways to build an OFX parser. One way is to
        build a compile-time DTD parser that treats the DTD as if
        it were an IDL, and generates C language stubs for a
        parser. This approach was attempted and abandoned because
        it leads to fragile C code and a very large binary.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>The parser is fragile because minor DTD
          non-compliances are hard to parse, handle and recover
          from.</li>

          <li>The parser is huge because the DTD results in
          hundreds of (C++) objects being generated.</li>
        </ul>
        The other method would be to perform run-time DTD parsing.
        This is attractive particularly because it is a more
        commonly-used approach; there are a variety of XML tools
        available that provide this function. 

        <p>Run-time parsing may be slower, but on the OFX client
        side, this should not be a bottleneck.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>A compile-time parser was developed and

        <p>Note that the organizations developing OFX are looking

        encourage the use of one of the many XML parsers available
        for UNIX.</p>

&gt;&gt; the German T-Online
&gt;&gt; homebanking system BTX.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I Germany we have a very popular online homebanking system,
&gt;&gt; based on the T-Online BTX (Datex-J) system. All of the
&gt;&gt; commercial homebanking software packages like MS-Money or
&gt;&gt; Quicken work with that online system. With that system,
&gt;&gt; you can retrieve  account data from your bank, and also
&gt;&gt; send your transfers.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I am using since more than 2 years a GPL software written
&gt;&gt; by a former colleague of mine, Niek Busscher, to work with
&gt;&gt; the T-Online homebanking system. That software package with
&gt;&gt; the name ZKA4BTX is very unknown, since Niek published it only
&gt;&gt; by email.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Some words to the features of ZKA4BTX :
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  - Completely written in Tcl
&gt;&gt;  - Uses Xcept as a BTX browser
&gt;&gt;  - Retrieve account data from multiple banks
&gt;&gt;  - Send transfers, using TAN
&gt;&gt;  - Export retrieved account data to CBB, Xfinans and QIF files      
&gt;&gt;  - Export retrieved account data to CBB, Xfinans and QIF files
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; With a simple click to an icon on my desktop, ZKA4BTX logs into
&gt;&gt; T-Online, gets all my account datas from several banks, and writes
&gt;&gt; (adds) it to my CBB, Xfinans or GnuCash (QIF) files.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Another very important thing is that I can do all my transfers
&gt;&gt; offline, editing a transfer sheet, and ZKA4BTX sends these
&gt;&gt; transfers in one step to my bank.
&gt;
&gt;One thing we could do in the short-medium term is have gnucash
&gt;launch ZKA4BTX to get the data, export it to QIF, and then load
&gt;it in, all through one command.

        The current system makes a distinction between the data

        data is embedded within and controlled by the "Engine",
        which is a set of routines to access accounts,
        transactions, etc. The engine serves as a kind of a dynamic
        cache between the permanent data repository (file, sql db)
        and the GUI. 

        <p>The current engine is rather simple: it provides support

        <p>Many of the features described elsewhere will require

        A module is necessary to allow data to be fetched from an
        SQL database, and for that database to be updated. 
        There has been <em>much</em> discussion about this on
        mailing lists both for GnuCash and 
        <a href="http://www.menet.umn.edu/~curt/cbb/">CBB.</a> 
        Major points have included:

        <br>
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>The use of a database allows only that data which
              is actually <em>in use</em> to be loaded into
              memory.  This permits managing larger sets of
              transactions more efficiently.
          </li>
          <br><br>

          <li>It also allows data to be pushed out to the DBMS
              <em>immediately after entry,</em> rather than waiting
              for the user to "save the books."
          </li>
          <br><br>

          <li>Using a client/server SQL database might make it easier
              to turn GnuCash into a multi-user system.
          </li>
          <br><br>

          <li>By using a well-known DBMS, outside programs are
              provided a well-defined way of getting at, and
              perhaps even modifying, GnuCash data. 
              (Actually, this is not true: GnuCash already provides
              a uniform, well-documented, preferred data access API.  
              As long as this
              API is used, there is some guarantee that data is stored
              in a self-consistent fashion.  Not using the GnuCash 
              programming interfaces risks corrupting the data.
              Direct access to the data is dangerous and discouraged.
              Furthermore, The API is guaranteed to be backwards
              compatible with a variety of data storage formats.
              Due to enhancements, the actual form of the data stored in
              a flat file, or in the SQL database, may change without 
              warning.)
          </li>
          <br><br>
          <li>
            Those SQL databases available on Linux tend to involve
            considerable <em>administrative</em> overhead in terms
            of getting them set up. 
            This may be a minor cost to a business enterprise
            that routinely hires Database Administrators.
            It is <em>not</em> acceptable to require this of
            naive users that may find "simple" things like
<pre>

# cd /tmp

            to be challenging.

          <br><br>

          <li>
            It might be useful to use an embedded database engine

            ISAM</a> (Note CQL++ supports ISAM access methods), or
            even an embedded SQL engine such as 
            <a href="http://www.ispras.ru/~knizhnik/gigabase.html">
            GigaBASE</a>.

          <li>
            GnuCash presently uses a document-oriented model, where
            the <em>entire</em> set of books are loaded in, and
            dumped out, all at one fell swoop. 
            GnuCash needs to be modified to access the database
            in a transactional manner. This is at least partly
            implemented with the <tt>Begin()/End()</tt> constructs
            in the engine.

            <p>
            Some transactional thoughts: entire SQL
            tables/databases do not need to be locked while the
            user is editing a transaction via the GUI.
            Instead, an optimistic approach, similar to that
            employed by CVS (concurrent version system, a mechanism
            for storing versions of source code) could be used: if
            the edits conflict with changes made by others, edits
            are be rejected en-masse, allowing the user to merge
            and correct their changes.
            Important note: updating SQL does <em>not</em>
            require locks to be held for extended periods of
            time!
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            The SQL engine chosen should be fully transactional,
            passing the 'ACID' test (Atomicity, Consistency,
            Isolation, Durability). 
            Note that 
            <a href="http://openacs.org/why-not-mysql.html">MySQL 
            does not satisfy the 'ACID' criteria</a>.

        interface, possibly using the register object as a browser
        plugin.
        The following industrial-strength features are
        needed:
        <br><br>

        <ul>
          <li>transaction-oriented queuing of updates</li>

          <li>event subscription channel for updates</li>

          <li>user authentication</li>

          <li>user authorization</li>

          <li>non-repudiability (needed only for peer-to-peer??)</li>

          <li>encryption of network connections</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
	<b>Status:</b> Partly done.  (gnucash 1.6.0, Linas)
	The postgres backend fully
	supports multiple simltaneous users. This includes 
	events for automatic updates of all GUI displays.
	However, the GUI support is rough, no GUI dialog 
	for user/password.  
	</p>
      </dd>

      <dt><a name="addressbook"><b>Address Book</b></a></dt>
      
      <dd>
        Provide support for client/vendor/customer address books,
	including street address, eamil, phone.  Also: to-do lists,
	a mini-contact manager (when is last time this person 
	was paid? what did they say on phone the last time we 
	sent them a check? Is there a dispute?)
	<p>
	Propose: use Ximian Evolution contact manager/to-do lists.
	</p>
      </dd>
      
      <dt><a name="arap"><b>Accounts Payable, Receivable</b></a></dt>

      <dd>Add features to track sales receipts and other pending
          sources of income, as well as owed sums.  
          <ul>
          <li>Need new account type 'ar' and 'ap'.  When this account type is
              selected, the register display, etc. is slightly different, as below:
          <li>Add field to register called 'date due'.  The date could be
              entered as 'date of transaction +30days'. etc.  The account
              could have a default: entries always default to +30 or +45 days
              or whatever.  
          <li>Create a report to match 'date due' to current date, and report
              overdue balances ...
          <li>Create Account aging report: show (average) age of 
              amount-due/amount-owed.   
          <li>Create a projected cash flow report: showing projected
              future payments based on date due.
          <li>Somehow, automatically match invoices to payments.
              When an invoice has been paid off, then there should be a 
              view mode where the invoice and its payment is no longer shown 
              (i.e. so that only outstanding, unpaid entries are shown ...)
          <li>create report showing everything but the a/p:
              Here's an example.  I buy a chair for a friend, and three
              days later he pays me back.  What I've been doing is ...
<pre>
>   1/12/01  Credit    -$100
>            A/R       +$100
>   1/15/01  Cash      +$100
>            A/R       -$100
</pre>
             To make it less painful to read and understand, the 
             report should look like:

<pre>
>   1/12/01 Credit -$100
>   1/15/01 Cash   +$100
</pre>
             i.e. there would be a new kind of 'transaction report' that 
             would pair up transactions in this way, showing things 
             'as if' the A/R didn't exist, and 'as if' a transaction
             was spread over a bunch of days.

          </ul>
          <p></p>
      </dd>

      <dt><a name="payroll"><b>Payroll</b></a></dt>

      <dd>
        Payroll introduces a <em>sizable</em> amount of complexity
        in terms of the need to comply with constantly-changing
        government regulations in whatever country one is in. 
        While the GnuCash "engine" might remain free,
        maintenance of payroll functionality would require
        "subscribing" to an update scheme; it might be troublesome
        to try to provide such a "subscription" free of charge.
        <p></p>
      </dd>

      <dt><a name="invoice"><b>Invoicing</b></a></dt>

      <dd>Invoicing.  Note that invoicing and order entry are 
          closely related.
          Several components:
        <ul>
        <li>Record an invoice. Assign it a serial number.  Be able
            to reprint/report based on invoice serial number.
        <li>Invoice associates customer name to set of transactions.
            Need to deal with PIM issue.  I.e. need to integrate
            with high-function PIM or CRM interface.
        <li>Allow historical browsing of invoices customer by customer.
        <li>To visually design an invoice, need to have a
            mini-word-processor/simple drawing plug-in. Is
            Abisource/Abiword a candidate? Probably needs bonobo...
        </ul>
      </dd>

      <dt><a name="order"><b>Order Entry</b></a></dt>

      <dd>
        Mini-GUI allowing users to type in orders.
        <ul>
        <li>Should interface to parts/inventory database to confirm 
            item availability, (maybe recommend additional production)?
            inventory should be updated after order placement.
        <li>Automatically update accounts receivable.
        <li>Allow order revision/update (esp. as partial orders are shipped).
        <li>Orders can be invoiced when entered (simple invoicing), or
            placed on account (double invoicing).
        <li>Allow back-orders to be printed customer-by-customer, or by 
            product/item.
        <li>Allow printing of packing slip.
        </ul>
        <p></p>
      </dd>

      <dt><a name="estimate"><b>Job Costing</b></a></dt>

      <dd>Ability to prepare and track estimates.
          <ul>
          <li>Allow estimate/bid to be converted to a firm order & get invoiced.
          </ul>
          <p></p>
      </dd>

      <dt><a name="expense"><b>Expense Accounts</b></a></dt>

      <dd>Expense Account Automation, including air, car, hotel,
          dining. Receipts, reservations, cancellations.
          <p></p>
      </dd>
