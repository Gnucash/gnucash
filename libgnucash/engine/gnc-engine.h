/** @brief IDENTIFIERS
 *  GncGUID Identifiers can be used to reference Accounts, Transactions,
 *  Splits and other objects. These Gnucash types are referred to as Gnucash
 *  entities. GncGUID Identifiers are globally-unique and permanent, i.e., once
 *  an entity has been assigned an identifier, it retains that same
 *  identifier for its lifetime.
 *  -
 *  Identifiers are 'typed' with strings. The ids used in gnucash are
 *  defined below. An id with type GNC_ID_NONE does not refer to any
 *  entity, although that may change as new ids are created. An id with
 *  type GNC_ID_NULL does not refer to any entity, and will never refer
 *  to any entity. An identifier with any other type may refer to an
 *  actual entity, but that is not guaranteed. If an id does refer to
 *  an entity, the type of the entity will match the type of the
 *  identifier.

/* TYPES **********************************************************/

/* CAS: ISTM, it would make more sense to put the typedefs in their
   corresponding header files, (e.g. Account.h), and to #include all
   the engine API header files right here.  After all, when I jump to
   the definition "Account", I want to end up in Account.h, not this
   file, like I do now.

   Also, as it is now, if I want to use the engine api, I need to
   include this header, plus all the other engine headers for the
   types whose functions I call, so this header is providing almost no
   benefit of aggregation.  But, if it included all the headers I
   could just include this file.  Or would that cause a massive
   recompile every time one engine header changed?
   Even if including all the headers here doesn't make sense, I think
   distributing the stuff in the "Types" section does.
