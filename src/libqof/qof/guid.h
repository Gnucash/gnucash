/** @addtogroup GncGUID
    Globally Unique IDs provide a way to uniquely identify
    something.  A GncGUID is a unique, cryptographically
    random 128-bit value.  The identifier is so random that
    it is safe to assume that there is no other such item
    on the planet Earth, and indeed, not even in the Galaxy
    or beyond.

    QOF GncGUIDs can be used independently of any other subsystem
    in QOF. In particular, they do not require the use of
    other parts of the object subsystem. New GncGUIDs are usually
    created by initializing a new entity using qof_instance_init,
    rather than calling GncGUID functions directly.
