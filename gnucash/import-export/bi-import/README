BAD THINGS ABOUT THE IMPORTER
The importer should be limited to a single invoice per file, perhaps creating a new invoice number each time.
Too many fields, and too inflexible field format.

QUOTING
Depending on the source of the CSV file, different quoting rules are used.
For example Calc quotes everything that looks like a string, ie
is not a number or a date.
Excel, on the other hand is quoting only those fields that contain a field
separator, therefore in a typical file most strings would not be quoted.
pgAdminIII is yet another CSV source. The SQL window has an option for
exporting query results to a CSV file with the following quoting options:
all fields, only strings, none. When I select 'only
strings', date fields get quoted, probably because the actual value that goes
to the file is the result of implicit to_char(date_value) function call.
The importer tries its best to work in all circumstances, by allowing quotes
on all fields, but not requiring them.
