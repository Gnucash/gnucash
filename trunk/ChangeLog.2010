	  Bug #95635: QIF import: Mark matched transactions as cleared
	  Patch by Tristan Faujour: Please describe the problem: My bank
	  allows me to download bank statement files in the QIF format.
	  They contain paid transactions, but there is no status ("C")
	  line, so all transactions are left in the "not cleared" status.
	  I wish it would be possible to define the default status in user
	  preferences. Steps to reproduce: - Import a QIF file with no "C"
	  line. Actual results: - Transactions are not cleared. Expected
	  results: - The "near split" of the imported transactions should
	  be set to a default status 'defined in user preferences). Does
	  this happen every time? - Yes Other information: - I developed a
	  patch. See attachment. It allows defining another status that
	  will be applied to the transactions that are imported as "not
	  cleared". - It is my first contribution, it should be taken with
	  all due prudence.

	  explicit lambda and the list to loop over is the last argument.
	  Especially the latter makes it very hard to read when the lambda

	  prevents the need of the cumbersome hash-fold and slightly
	  better hash-for-each (which still suffers from the same problems
	  as for-each and is not available in guile 1.6). This new syntax
	  allows for three distinct syntaxes: * Looping over a single
	  list: (for a in lst do (display a)) * Looping over multiple
	  lists: (for (a b) in (lsta lstb) do (display (+ a b))) * Looping
	  over a hash: (for key => value in hash do (display (* key

	* [r19854] src/business/business-gnome/dialog-payment.c: Bug
	  #635439: Fix "Pay invoice" while the invoice dialog is open.
	  Patch by Matthijs Kooijman <matthijs@stdin.nl>: If you use "Pay
	  invoice", normally a new payment dialog is opened which is
	  completely filled in. However, when there was already a dialog
	  open, it was reused but only the owner would be filled in. This
	  patch makes sure that the invoice and amount are filled in as
	  well.
	* [r19853] src/business/business-gnome/business-gnome-utils.c,
	  src/business/business-gnome/dialog-payment.c: Bug #635439: Patch
	  to autoset owner in the payment dialog Patch by Matthijs
	  Kooijman <matthijs@stdin.nl>: In the payment dialog, set the
	  owner when an invoice is selected Before, you would always need
	  to select an owner manually. If you would just select an invoice
	  (which was possible, since the invoice selection is not disabled
	  when no owner has been selected yet), pressing OK would error
	  out because no owner was selected. This patch makes sure that
	  when an invoice is selected, but no owner is selected yet, the
	  right owner is filled into the owner selection box
	  automatically. This also happens when the wrong owner is
	  selected, which can happen because the invoice autocompletion is
	  not limited to invoices from the selected owner, but always
	  completes all invoices. This could cause weird behaviour: Select
	  an owner, then use completion to select an invoice by another
	  owner and press ok. This would cause the amount for the invoice
	  by the other owner to be charged against the first owner. This
	  patch prevents that by replacing the first owner by the other
	  owner in the dialog. This patch also changes
	  gnc_invoice_set_owner to no longer reset the invoice selection
	  to NULL. Instead, this is now handled by

	  clobber warning A fairly extensive change, because I changed
	  may_clobber from a global qof function (which passed through
	  qofbackend and fetched up in the actual backends) to a local
	  static in the individual backends which raise a new
	  qof_backend_error, QOF_ABCKEND_STORE_EXISTS. This was necessary
	  to reorder the existence check before the lock, because with the
	  sql backends, locking creates the database... which then would
	  return may_clobber as true, even though it really wasn't. New
	  parameter "force" added to session_begin() functions, and
	  "create_if_nonexistant" is renamed to simply "create". The
	  reason for the latter is that the file/database is created
	  regardless of whether it already exists; that's what the clobber
	  check is about. The new "force" parameter is set to true the
	  second time through, after the user has responded to the clobber
	  dialog indicating that the data should be destroyed. Many of the
	  extraneous changes are just adding the new parameter to the
	  session_begin() calls. gnc-file changes to handle the error in
	  favor of calling the no-longer-existing
	  qof_check_may_clobber_data() call after session_begin(). Two
	  minor changes to gnc_file_do_save_as: gnc_add_history and
	  gnc_hook_run are now called on new_session instead of
	  old_session; this ensures that the new file/database is used at
	  the next startup of gnucash. Second, the filename/url is
	  filtered before displaying the "may_clobber" dialog box to
	  prevent displaying plaintext database passwords.

	* [r19744] src/engine/Scrub.c: Bugs 632346 & 632166: Fixup
	  transaction currency scrubbing. Biggest problem was that almost
	  well-formed transactions missing a currency element wouldn't
	  import correctly because the FindCommonCurrencies function only
	  used the old currency values, ignoring the commodity values in
	  the splits' accounts. A new function,
	  xaccFindCommonCurrencies(), looks at those first and then calls
	  xaccFindOldCommonCurrencies only if it fails. That addresses the
	  cause of the import failure reported in 632166 and a big chunk
	  of the warning messages complained about in 632346. A secondary
	  problem, also addressed in this change, was that the last block
	  in xaccTransScrubCurrencyFromSplits always replaced the "amount"
	  with the "value". This is the right thing to do if the commodity
	  for the split account is a currency, but if it isn't, the
	  replacement should be reversed.

	* [r19743] src/backend/xml/gnc-account-xml-v2.c: Revised handling
	  of obsolete security elements, made log messages better.
	  Accounts with security elements would only use the security to
	  update the commodity if there wasn't a commodity; however, the
	  files in the tests had accounts which had a security and a
	  commodity, where the commodity was a currency. That's wrong. so
	  now if the commodity is a currency, the security will overwrite
	  it. Added the account name and element name to the log message
	  to assist in troubleshooting, should that be needed.

	  session (with an invalid database) would remain the current

	  dialog would be presented with no instructions about what was
	  going on. With this change, if the "save as" fails, the old
	  session is restored, still marked unsaved. This should be much
	  less confusing to users and more likely to avoid data loss. Yes,
	  there's some duplicated code now, because do_save_as doesn't
	  call save. That's because save did some extra things that
	  do_save_as doesn't need and it didn't allow do_save_as to
	  properly correct the session. This could be refactored into some
	  tiny functions, but that seems a bit excessive to me.

	  report writers and for this reason they are already added. Note:
	  The original submission would have added those options to the
	  standard relative-date chooser report option, but I (cstim) do
	  not support adding those extra option for all reports as
	  standard setting. Hence, the usage of this additional choices
	  has to be added by the report writer explicitly.

	* [r19638] src/backend/xml/gnc-backend-xml.c: Bug #593479: Ensure
	  not to accidentally delete our main account file. Original patch
	  by Tim Retout who writes: strptime is passed (name + pathlen +
	  1) as the string to search. However, when looking at the main
	  account file, strlen(name) == pathlen, so strptime is looking at
	  the point just past the end of name. Sometimes this will be
	  parseable by strptime, and this leads to the account file being
	  unlinked.

	* [r19528] packaging/win32/gnucash.iss.in: Bug #588414 - Got
	  "Entry Point Not Found" errors starting GnuCash, but ran OK The
	  problem is caused by leftover files from a previous install. The
	  solution is to uninstall GnuCash before installing a new version
	  in such cases. This commit adds a compatibility test and
	  uninstall step to the windows installer that will automatically
	  uninstall the previous gnucash release if it is considered
	  'incompatible' with the one to be installed. The user will be
	  warned of this, so he can decide to cancel the installation if
	  he doesn't like the idea of uninstalling his working GnuCash
	  installation. Currently, versions are considered 'incompatible'
	  if their major or minor version components are different, so
	  2.3.x is incompatible with 2.2.x and will trigger an uninstall.
	  Likewise, a 2.4.x install is incompatible with a 2.3.x and will
	  trigger an uninstall. This is a nice way to remove all testing
	  'cruft' from the system once the new release comes out. Note
	  that in the future installing 2.3.16+ over 2.4.x will also
	  trigger the uninstall, which is a good thing IMO. An older
	  release can't know about changes made in a newer one, so it's
	  safer to first uninstall the newer one to avoid leftover files.

	  Patch by Mike E and Mark Jenkins: When creating or appending to
	  invoices, customers and bills, searching by ID is likely more
	  useful than by GUID. I've added this functionality to the Python
	  bindings. Search by ID using the python code: tmp =
	  gnucash.gnucash_core_c.search_invoice_on_id(ID,book.instance) if
	  tmp: invoice = gnucash.gnucash_business.Invoice(instance=tmp)
	  Use the invoice object as in
	  sample_scripts/simple_invoice_insert.py I support this patch,
	  but I've made a few improvments of my own. I switched up the
	  arguments in search_customer_on_id, search_invoice_on_id,
	  search_bill_on_id to have Book first and ID second. The reason
	  for this was to make these functions more consistent with the
	  other functions where a search is done through a book on a
	  particular attribute. Also added some specific python bindings
	  support to allow this to be used as methods of Book:
	  Book.CustomerLookupByID, Book.InvoiceLookupByID,
	  Book.BillLoookupByID.
	* [r19430] src/report/report-system/eguile-gnc.scm: Bug #624721:
	  Show backtrace for errors in eguile templates Patch by Matthijs
	  Kooijman: The current eguile template implementation catches
	  errors that occur while evaluating an eguile template. However,
	  only the error is shown, not a backtrace (so no location of the
	  error either). The attached patch modifies the error handling to
	  also capture the stack backtrace, using a lazy exception handler
	  (e.g., capture the stack before unwinding the stack to the real
	  exception handler). To extract only the relevant part of the
	  stack (e.g., the part inside the eguile template, not the tens
	  of stack frames leading up to the report rendering), a stack
	  dump is made just before evaluating the eguile template (so a
	  sort of "diff" can be made). For more details, see the extensive
	  comments in the patch itself.

	  src/report/stylesheets/stylesheet-plain.scm: Bug #626403: Fix
	  inconsistent formatting between stylesheets (Webkit vs. gtkhtml)
	  Patch by Alex Aycinena: The 'default' stylesheet formats the
	  balance sheet, cash flow, income statement and transaction
	  reports properly under webkit but not under gtkhtml. The 'easy',
	  'footer', and 'technicolor' stylesheets are the reverse; that
	  is, they format the balance sheet, cash flow, income statement
	  and transaction reports properly under gtkhtml but not under
	  webkit, except that the 'footer' stylesheet also has some
	  formatting problems with gtkhtml as well. The attached patch
	  file corrects these problems. Specifically: - styles that are
	  missing in the 'footer' stylesheet (compared to 'easy') are
	  added - the function 'gnc-html-engine-supports-css' is used in
	  the 'default', 'easy', 'footer' and 'technicolor' stylesheets to
	  provide styles for either webkit or gtkhtml - the taxtxf.scm
	  report file is simplified to take advantage of these changes

	  Jeff Kletsky. (Cstim: Accepted even though string freeze is in
	  effect because it was submitted before the freeze. Also, the
	  string additions are very minor.) Summary of Changes: * Initial
	  story related to providing default budget control * Add a
	  "Budgeting" tab to the book-level preferences dialog * Add a
	  "Default Budget" selector to the "Budgeting" tab * Modify
	  gnc_budget_get_default() to * Respect the new KVP, if present *
	  Fall back to 2.2.x behavior, if not present * Modify
	  gnc:make-budget-option * Reformatted for readability with
	  additional comments * Default is now "#f" so that selected value
	  is always saved Otherwise, if selection happened to be the
	  current default and the default was later changed, the report
	  would change * getter, setter, and generate-restore-form all now
	  consistent * setter now always takes a budget object *
	  generate-restore-form does not rely on "hack" in setter that
	  previously allowed either a budget object or a GUID string This
	  is a different fix for 603215 -- see Known Issues * Provide
	  translation support for "Trading Acccounts" (and "Budgeting") *
	  Refactor #define names for consistency and extensibility *
	  KVP_OPTION_PATH for consistency with Guile usage *
	  OPTION_SECTION_blahblah * OPTION_NAME_blahblah * Modify
	  qofbookslots.h to be "SWIG-aware" * Pick up qofbookslots.h in
	  make-gnucash-potfiles.in and po/POTFILES.in Known Issues: *
	  There is no selection (yet) for "Use default budget" so changing
	  the default budget and reloading a report does not change the
	  budget used * setter is no more robust to "bad" values than in
	  previous code * Budget reports created with 2.3.x after r18528
	  (between 2.3.8 and 2.3.9) may not load or re-render as they
	  relied on the setter taking either a budget object or a GUID as
	  a string This should not impact any 2.2.x users as nothing was
	  saved under 2.2.x related to the default budget. This can be
	  resolved through removing the option restore code in
	  ~/.gnucash/saved-reports-2.4 and, if affected reports were open,
	  in ~/.gnucash/books/<name_of_book> * Budget reports prior to
	  r18528 did not save budget selection (603215)

	  to be a deliberate choice, as can be seen in line 1308 of
	  gnome/dialog-sx-editor.c routine schedXact_editor_create_ledger.
	  I disagree. Since Notes are not copied to the newly-created
	  scheduled transaction, there is no way for the user to copy
	  Notes to the model, nor to modify the Notes. This makes the
	  partial fix in r16652 for bug 500427 kind of pointless. This

	  Banner Image does not display or print on invoice reports Along
	  with a new version of webkit which properly handles local image
	  files, a change was needed so that instead of creating an html
	  string and feeding it directly to webkit, it is exported to a
	  temp file which is then loaded as a file:// URI. On Linux, if
	  this is not done, any embedded images do not appear, and there
	  is a console message that local resources can't be loaded. On
	  Windows, the embedded images don't appear, possibly for the same
	  reason, but I'm not sure where the console messages go.

	* [r18893] src/libqof/qof/qofinstance.c,
	  src/libqof/qof/qofinstance.h: Add some new gobject-related
	  infrastructure so that when deleting an object, it can be
	  determined if there are other objects with references to that
	  object (bug 140400). Some routines are normal routines, and some
	  routines use the gobject structure to allow different
	  implementations by different object types. Per-instance routine:
	  gboolean qof_instance_refers_to_object(QofInstance* A,
	  QofInstance* B) - returns TRUE/FALSE whether object A contains a
	  reference to object B. Normal routine: GList*
	  qof_instance_get_referring_object_list_from_collection(QofCollection*
	  c, QofInstance* B) - Calls qof_instance_refers_to_object() for
	  each object in the collection, and returns a list of the objects
	  which contain a reference to B. Per-instance routine: GList*
	  qof_instance_get_typed_referring_object_list(QofInstance* A,
	  QofInstance* B) - returns a list of all objects of the same type
	  as A which contain a reference to B. Being per-instance allows
	  an object to use knowledge to avoid scanning cases where there
	  are no references (e.g. billterms do not contain references to
	  splits), or a scan is not needed (references from splits to an
	  account can be determined using xaccAccountGetSplitList()). This
	  routine can do a scan by calling
	  qof_instnace_get_referring_object_list_from_collection(). Normal
	  routine: qof_instance_get_referring_object_list(QofInstance* A)
	  - For all collections in the book, gets an instance and calls
	  its qof_instance_get_typed_referring_object_list() routine,
	  concatenating all of the returned lists. This is the routine
	  that external code can call to get a list of all objects with
	  references to an object A. The list must be freed by the caller
	  but the contents must not. Per-instance routine: gchar*
	  qof_instance_get_display_name(QofInstance* A) - returns a string
	  which can identify object A to the user. This could be used to
	  display a list of the objects returned by
	  qof_instance_get_referring_object_list() ("Invoice 0004 for
	  customer C") so that the user can modify those objects to remove
	  the references. Note that this is going to require
	  internationalization, which has not been implemented yet. If not
	  overridden by the object class, the default string is "Object
	  <type> <address>" e.g. "Object gncCustomer 0x12345678".

	  normalized uri format internally to refer to data stores. Data
	  stores for GC can be a file (xml or sqlite3) or a database one
	  some server (mysql or postgres). Wherever it makes sense
	  internally, data stores will be referred to via a normalized
	  uri: protocol://user:password@host:port/path Depending on the
	  context and story type some of these parts are optional or
	  unused. To achieve this, a new utility interface has been setup:
	  gnc_uri_<xxx>_<yyy> that can be used to manipulate the uris or
	  convert from non-normalized formats to normalized and back. For
	  example, when the user selects a file in the Open or Save As
	  dialog, gnc_uri_get_normalized_uri will convert the file into a
	  normalized uri. Or when the actual filename is needed this can
	  be extracted with gnc_uri_get_path. You can also test if a uri
	  defines a file or something else with gnc_uri_is_file_uri. For
	  the complete documentation, see src/core-utils/gnc-uri-uitls.h
	  This commit installs gnc-uri-utils and modifies the source where
	  it makes sense to use its convenience functions. This concerns
	  all functions that had to deal with file access in some way or
	  another, the history module and the functions that generate the
	  history menu list and the window titles. Note that gnc-uri-utils
	  replaces xaccResolveFilePath and xaccResolveUrl in all cases.
	  xaccResolveUrl has been removed, because gnc-uri-utils fully
	  replaces its functionality. xaccResolveFilePath is used
	  internally in gnc-uri-utils to ensure an absolute path is always
	  returned (in case of a file uri, not for db uris). But it has
	  been renamed to gnc_resolve_file_path to be more consistent with
	  the other functions. Lastly, this commit also adds a first
	  implementation to work with a keyring to store and retrieve
	  passwords, althoug

	  font is too small to read with webkit as html renderer. From
	  comment 23: "The PDF in comment 2 is about 8 times smaller than
	  it should be. One possible cause of this bug is if
	  gtk_print_operation_set_unit (op, GTK_UNIT_POINTS) is not
	  called. gtkprint defaults to GTK_UNIT_PIXEL - a useless unit to
	  be using with printers. On Linux GTK_UNIT_PIXEL units are 1 unit
	  = 1/72 inch (the same as GTK_UNIT_POINTS as well as PostScript
	  and PDF units). On Windows GTK_UNIT_PIXEL units are the GDI
	  device units which for printers is the dpi resolution. So for a
	  600dpi printer 1 unit is 1/600". If the application was
	  developed on Linux and assumes the default gtkprint units are
	  always 1/72" inch the output on Windows using a 600dpi printer
	  will be 72/600 = 0.12 of the size (or approximately 1/8 of the
	  size)." Solution was to use webkit_web_frame_print_full() which
	  allows us to provide our own GtkPrintOperation object with units
	  set to GTK_UNIT_POINTS. Tested on both Linux and Windows.

	  Make libqof compatible for MSVC9.0 compiler (no joke). The main
	  change is that the syntax for variadic macros is slightly
	  different in MSVC compared to gcc. But they exist, so offering
	  the log macros in the different syntax is sufficient.

	  compiling our own binary of libbonoboui because the
	  ftp.gnome.org binary still depends on the obsolete libxml2.dll.
	  However, we still download the erroneous binary and unpack it
	  into $GNOME_DIR because libgnomeui depends on libbonoboui which
	  in turn depends on libgnome. Hence, libbonoboui cannot be
	  compiled before libgnome-dev is unpacked, but libgnomeui won't
	  report to be installed correctly before libbonoboui is available
	  as well. Theoretically, we would have to split the inst_gnome
	  step so that it first unpacks libgnome et al., then we run the
	  inst_libbonoboui step, then we run the second part of inst_gnome
	  which would be something like inst_gnomeui. I'm lazy, so I
	  silently overwrite the libbonoboui DLL with our hand-compiled
	  version and that's it.

	  not printed in the invoice. I think this is a bug rather than a
	  feature. I have attached a patch to fix. It still prints the

	  additional patch to provide an invoice option to toggle printing
	  of the company name if users/developers feel they want this
	  option, as I do.

	  #608436: Add auto-clear feature Patch by Cristian KLEIN: = Usage
	  scenario = John keeps his personal accounting in GnuCash and
	  writes all credit card expenses therein. On weekends, we checks
	  his Internet Banking and sees that some transactions have been
	  recorded. He would like to clear those transactions in GnuCash,
	  but it is tiresome to go through each Internet Banking
	  transaction and do manual comparison with GnuCash records,
	  especially since Internet Banking transactions might be in a
	  different order than in GnuCash. John would prefer having an
	  "auto-clear" feature. Given the "current amount" from the
	  Internet Banking, he would like GnuCash to clear the
	  transactions for him, if and only if, there is a unique
	  combination of transactions that could achieve this. If there is
	  no solution, or if the solution is not unique, GnuCash should
	  warn him and John must manually clear the transactions.

	  #607522: Add ADDRESS to check printing Patch by Thomas Troesch:
	  The patch does three things: 1. Adds the ability to print an
	  address on checks. The Print Check dialog is changed to have 5
	  address lines. The first field is filled in with the same data
	  as the PAYEE check item. The other lines are blank. The check
	  format keys have a new check-item type 'ADDRESS'. It behaves
	  like other text check-item types. The address fields on the
	  dialog are set 'not-sensitive' if the current format does not
	  have an ADDRESS check item defined. The Custom Field tab has a
	  new line for the address location. 2. Added new check format key
	  - Blocking_Chars. This is to put the blocking character feature
	  into the check format file. It is currently only in the
	  preferences dialog in the printing tab, and therefore currently
	  applies (or not) to all text fields in th_e check format. By
	  adding the key Blocking_Chars_n to the check format, the
	  blocking characters can be applied to text type check-items
	  individually. Its really useful when printing stubs and so on.
	  (NOTE: blocking characters are printed around a field to protect
	  against alteration e.g. ***$100.00*** vs $100.00) 3. Included a
	  Voucher check template. This is a full page check with the check
	  on top and which has two stubs below. There are other voucher
	  formats ( middle and bottom ) , but the check printing
	  functionality would require separate templates for the different
	  formats. Also changed the Quicken/Quickbooks US-Letter check
	  format to include the ADDRESS check item and blocking around the
	  AMOUNT_NUMBER field. I made a change to the Quicken-wallet check
	  to add blocking characters around the AMOUNT_NUMBER field, and I
	  added a clipping rectangle definition to the NOTES and PAYEE
	  fields the were placed in the check stub area ( if the fields
	  were too long, they would print into the check area ).

	  Fix uncommon configure option --program-suffix. Patch by Peter
	  Selinger: OK, the attached patch fixes part of this problem.
	  Specifically, it applies the specified transform (from
