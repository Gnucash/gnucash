    @brief Functions for adding plugins to a GnuCash window.
    @author Copyright (C) 2003 Jan Arne Petersen
    @author Copyright (C) 2003,2005 David Hampton <hampton@employees.org>

    A GncPlugin is the basic object for adding a menu item or items to
    the GnuCash user interface.  This object should be instantiated
    once at startup time and passed to the plugin manager.  Whenever a
    new window is opened, the main window code will ask the plugin
    manager for a list of all plugins, and will add each plugin to the
    new window by calling the gnc_plugin_add_to_window function.  This
    function handles installing the plugin's actions, and then calls
    the plugin to allow it to perform any plugin specific actions.
    When a main window is closed, the gnc_plugin_remove_from_window
    function is called, which first calls the plugin to perform plugin
    specific actions and then removes the plugin's actions from the
    window.
