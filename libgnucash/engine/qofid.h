/** @addtogroup Entities

    This file defines an API that adds types to the GncGUID's.
    GncGUID's with types can be used to identify and reference
    typed entities.

    The idea here is that a GncGUID can be used to uniquely identify
    some thing.  By adding a type, one can then talk about the
    type of thing identified.  By adding a collection, one can
    then work with a handle to a collection of things of a given
    type, each uniquely identified by a given ID.  QOF Entities
    can be used independently of any other part of the system.
    In particular, Entities can be useful even if one is not using
    the Query one Object parts of the QOF system.

    Identifiers are globally-unique and permanent, i.e., once
    an entity has been assigned an identifier, it retains that same
    identifier for its lifetime.
    Identifiers can be encoded as hex strings.

    GncGUID Identifiers are 'typed' with strings.  The native ids used
    by QOF are defined below.
	-# An id with type QOF_ID_NONE does not
    refer to any entity.
	-# An id with type QOF_ID_NULL does not refer
	to any entity, and will never refer to any entity.
	=# An identifier with any other type may refer to an
    actual entity, but that is not guaranteed as that entity does
	not have to exist within the current book. (See ::PARTIAL_QOFBOOK).
	Also, creating a new entity from a data source involves creating
	a temporary GncGUID and then setting the value from the data source.
	If an id does refer to an entity, the type of the entity will match
	the type of the identifier.

    If you have a type name, and you want to have a way of finding
    a collection that is associated with that type, then you must use
    Books.

	Entities can refer to other entities as well as to the basic
	QOF types, using the qofclass parameters.
