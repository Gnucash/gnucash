<P>Financial Calculator
<!-- <p>Copyright (C) 1990 - 2000 Terry D. Boldt, All Rights Reserved -->

<!-- <p>This version for use WITH ANSI.SYS display driver -->

<p>This is  a complete  financial computation  utility to  solve for  the five
standard financial values: n, %i, PV, PMT and FV
<ul>
<ul>
<li>n   == number of payment periods
<li>%i  == nominal interest rate, NAR, charged
<li>PV  == Present Value of money
<li>PMT == Periodic Payment
<li>FV  == Future Value of money
</ul>
</ul>

<p>In addition, four additional parameters may be specified:
<ol>
<li>Compounding Frequency per year, CF. The number of times the interest is compounded
during the year. The default is 12. The compounding frequency per year may be
different from the Payment Frequency per year

<li>Payment Frequency per year, PF. The number of payments made in a year. Default is 12.

<li>Discrete or continuous compounding, disc. The default is discrete compounding.

<li>Payments may be at the beginning or end of the payment period, beg. The default is for
payments to be made at the end of the payment period.
</ol>

<p>When an amortization schedule is desired, the financial transaction Effective Date, ED,
and Initial Payment Date, IP, must also be entered.

<p>Canadian  and  European  style  mortgages  can  be  handled  in  a simple,
straight-forward manner. Standard financial sign conventions are used:

<hr size=4>
<p align="center">"Money paid out is Negative, Money received is Positive"
<hr size=4>

<A NAME="TimeValue">
<H1>Time Value of Money</H1></A>
<p>If you borrow money, you can expect  to pay rent or interest for its  use;
conversely you expect to receive rent interest on money you loan or invest.
When you rent property, equipment,  etc., rental payments are normal;  this
is  also  true  when  renting  or  borrowing  money.  Therefore,  money  is
considered to have a "time value". Money available now, has a greater value
than money available at some future date because of its rental value or the
interest that it can produce during the intervening period.

<A NAME="SimpleInterest">
<H2>Simple Interest</H2></A>
<p>If you loaned $800 to  a friend with an agreement  that at the end of  one
year he would  would repay you  $896, the "time  value" you placed  on your
$800 (principal) was $96 (interest) for  the one year period (term) of  the
loan. This  relationship of  principal, interest,  and time (term) is  most
frequently expressed as an Annual  Percentage Rate (APR). In this  case the
APR  was  12.0%  [(96/800)*100].  This  example  illustrates the four basic
factors involved  in a  simple interest  case. The  time period (one year),
rate (12.0%  APR), present  value of  the principal  ($800) and  the future
value of the principal including interest ($896).

<A NAME="CompoundInterest">
<H2>Compound Interest</H2></A>
<p>In many cases the interest charge is computed periodically during the term
of  the  agreement.  For  example,  money  left  in a savings account earns
interest that  is periodically  added to  the principal  and in  turn earns
additional interest during succeeding periods. The accumulation of interest
during  the  investment  period  represents  compound interest. If the loan
agreement you  made with  your friend  had specified  a "compound  interest
rate" of  12% (compounded  monthly) the  $800 principal  would have  earned
$101.46 interest for the  one year period. The  value of the original  $800
would be increased  by 1% the  first month to  $808 which in  turn would be
increased  by  1%  to  816.08 the second month,  reaching a future value of
$901.46 after the twelfth iteration. The monthly compounding of the nominal
annual rate (NAR) of 12% produces an effective Annual Percentage Rate (APR)
of 12.683% [(101.46/800)*100].  Interest may be  compounded at any  regular
interval; annually, semiannually, monthly, weekly, daily, even continuously
(a specification in some financial models).

<A NAME="PeriodicPayments">
<H2>Periodic Payments</H2></A>
<p>When money is loaned for longer  periods of time, it is customary  for the
agreement to require the borrower  to make periodic payments to  the lender
during the term of the loan. The payments may be only large enough to repay
the interest,  with the  principal due  at the  end of  the loan period (an
interest only loan), or large enough  to fully repay both the interest  and
principal during the term of the loan (a fully amoritized loan). Many loans
fall somewhere between, with payments that do not fully cover repayment  of
both the principal and interest. These loans require a larger final payment
(balloon)  to  complete  their  amortization.  Payments  may  occur  at the
beginning or end of a payment period. If you and your friend had agreed  on
monthly repayment of  the $800 loan  at 12% NAR  compounded monthly, twelve
payments of $71.08 for a total of $852.96 would be required to amortize the
loan. The $101.46  interest from the  annual plan is  more than the  $52.96
under the monthly plan because under the monthly plan your friend would not
have had the use of $800 for a full year.

<A NAME="FinTrans">
<H2>Financial Transactions</H2></A>
<p>The  above  paragraphs  introduce  the  basic  factors  that  govern  most
financial  transactions;  the  time  period,  interest rate, present value,
payments and  the future  value. In  addition, certain  conventions must be
adhered to: the interest rate must be relative to the compounding frequency
and payment periods, and the term must be expressed as the total number  of
payments (or compounding periods if there are no payments). Loans,  leases,
mortgages, annuities, savings plans, appreciation, and compound growth  are
among the many financial problems that can be defined in these terms. Some
transactions do not involve payments, but  all of the other factors play  a
part in "time value of money" transactions. When any one of the five  (four
- if no payments are involved)  factors is unknown, it can be  derived from
formulas using the known factors.

<A NAME="Interest">
<h1>Interest</h1></A>
<p>Before discussing the financial equation, we will discuss interest. Most
financial transactions utilize a nominal interest rate, NAR, i.e., the interest
rate per year. The NAR must be converted to the interest rate per payment
period and the compounding accounted for before it can be used in computing
an interest payment. After this conversion process, the interest used is the
effective interest rate, EIR. In converting NAR to EIR, there are two concepts
to discuss first, the Compounding Frequency and the Payment Frequency and
whether the interest is compounded in discrete intervals or continuously.

<A NAME="CompFreq">
<h2>Compounding Frequency</h2></A>
<p>The compounding Frequency, CF, is simply the number of times per year, the
monies in the financial transaction are compounded. In the U.S., monies
are usually compounded daily on bank deposits, and monthly on loans. Sometimes
long term deposits are compounded quarterly or weekly.

<A NAME="PayFreq">
<h2>Payment Frequency</h2></A>
<p>The Payment Frequency, PF, is simply how often during a year payments are
made in the transaction. Payments are usually scheduled on a regular basis
and can be made at the beginning or end of the payment period. If made at
the beginning of the payment period, interest must be applied to the payment
as well as any previous money paid or money still owed.

<A NAME="NorVal">
<h2>Normal CF/PF Values</h2></A>
<p>Normal values for CF and PF are:
<ul>
<ul>
<li>1   == annual
<li>2   == semi-annual
<li>3   == tri-annual
<li>4   == quaterly
<li>6   == bi-monthly
<li>12  == monthly
<li>24  == semi-monthly
<li>26  == bi-weekly
<li>52  == weekly
<li>360 == daily
<li>365 == daily
</ul>
</ul>

<p>The  Compounding  Frequency per year,  CF,  need not be identical  to the
Payment Frequency per year, PF. Also,
Interest may be compounded in either discrete intervals or continuously
compounded and payments may be made at the beginning of the payment period or at the
end of the payment period.

<p>CF and PF are defaulted to  12. The default is for discrete interest intervals
and payments are defaulted to the end of the payment period.

<p>When a solution  for n, PV,  PMT or FV  is required, the  nominal interest
rate, i, must first be converted to the effective interest rate per payment
period. This rate, ieff, is then used to compute the selected variable.  To
convert i to ieff, the following expressions are used:

<A NAME="DiscIntNARtoEIR">
<h2>NAR to EIR for Discrete Interest Periods</h2></A>
<p>To convert NAR to EIR for discrete interest periods:

<p>ieff = (1 + i/CF)^(CF/PF) - 1

<A NAME="ContIntNARtoEIR">
<h2>NAR to EIR for Continuous Compounding</h2></A>
<p>to convert NAR to EIR for Continuous Compounding:

<p>ieff = e^(i/PF) - 1 = exp(i/PF) - 1

<p>When interest is computed, the computation produces the effective interest
rate, ieff. This value must then be converted to the nominal interest rate.
Function  _I  in the <tt>"fin.exp"</tt> utility returns  the  nominal  interest
rate NOT the effective interest rate. ieff is converted to i using the following expressions:

<A NAME="DiscIntEIRtoNAR">
<h2>EIR to NAR for Discrete Interest Periods</h2></A>
<p>To convert EIR to NAR for discrete interest periods:

<p>i = CF*([(1+ieff)^(PF/CF) - 1)

<A NAME="ContIntEIRtoNAR">
<h2>EIR to NAR for Continuous Compounding</h2></A>
<p>To convert EIR to NAR for continuous compounding:

<p>i = ln((1+ieff)^PF)

<!--#############################################################################-->

<!--#############################################################################-->

<A NAME="FinEquation">
<H1>Financial Equation</h1></A>
<p>NOTE: in the equations below for the financial transaction, all interest rates
are the effective interest rate, <tt>ieff</tt>. The symbol will be shortned to just <tt>i</tt>.

<p>The financial equation used to inter-relate n,i,PV,PMT and FV is:

<p>1) PV*(1 + i)^n + PMT*(1 + iX)*[(1+i)^n - 1]/i + FV = 0

<pre>
   Where: X   == 0 for end of period payments, and
          X   == 1 for beginning of period payments
          n   == number of payment periods
          i   == effective interest rate for payment period
          PV  == Present Value
          PMT == periodic payment
          FV  == Future Value
</pre>

<A NAME="FinDeriv">
<h2>Financial Equation Derivation</h2></A>
<p>The derivation of the financial equation is contained in the
<A HREF="finderv.html#TOP">Financial Equations</A>
section.


<!--#############################################################################-->

<A NAME="AmortSched">
<h1>Amortization Schedules.</h1></A>

<A NAME="ED_IP_Dates">
<h2>Effective and Initial Payment Dates</h2></A>
<p>Financial Transactions have an effective Date, ED, and an Initial Payment
Date, IP. ED may or may not be the same as IP, but IP is always the same
or later than ED. Most financial transaction calculators assume that
IP is equal to ED for beginning of period payments or at the end of the
first payment period for end of period payments.

<p>This is not always true. IP may be delayed for financial reasons such as cash
flow or accounting calendar. The subsequent payments then follow the
agreed upon periodicity.

<A name="Eff_PV">
<h2>Effective Present Value</h2></A>
<p>Since money has a time value, the "delayed" IP
must be accounted for. Computing an "Effective PV", pve, is one means of
handling a delayed IP.

<p>If

<pre>
ED_jdn == the Julian Day Number of ED, and
IP_jdn == the Julian Day Number of IP
</pre>

<p>pve is computed as:

<pre>
   pve = pv*(1 + i)^(s*PF/d*CF)

   Where: d = length of the payment period in days, and
          s = IP_jdn - ED_jdn - d*(1 - X)
</pre>

<A name="iterative_soltn">
<h2>Iterative Amortization Schedule</h2></A>
<p>Computing an amortization Schedule for a given financial transaction is
simply applying the basic equation iteratively for each payment period:

<pre>
   PV[n] = PV[n-1] + (PMT + (PV[n-1] + X * PMT) * i)
         = PV[n-1] * (1 + i) + PMT * (1 + iX)
    for n >= 1
</pre>

<p>At the end of each iteration, PV[n] is rounded to the nearest cent. For
each payment period, the interest due may be computed separately as:

<pre>
   ID[n] = (PV[n-1] + X * PMT) * i
</pre>

<p>and rounded to the nearest cent. PV[n] then becomes:

<pre>
   PV[n] = PV[n-1] + PMT + ID[n]
</pre>

<A name="AnnualSum">
<h2>Annual Summary</h2></A>
<p>For those cases where a yearly summary only is desired, it is not necessary
to compute each transaction for each payment period, rather the PV may be
be computed for the beginning of each year, PV[yr], and the FV computed for
the end of the year, FV[yr]. The interest paid during the year is the computed as:

<pre>
   ID[yr] = (NP * PMT) + PV[yr] + FV[yr]
    where: NP == number of payments during year
              == PF for a full year of payments
</pre>

<A name="FinalPayment">
<h2>Final Payment Calculation</h2></A>
<p>Since the final payment may not be equal to the periodic payment, the final
payment must be computed separately as follows. Two derivations are given below
for the final payment equation. Both derivations are given below since one or
the other may be clearer to some readers. Both derivations are essentially
the same, they just have different starting points. The first is the fastest to derive.

<p>Note, for the purposes of computing an amortization table, the number of periodic
payments is assumed to be an integral value. For most cases this is true, the two
principles in any transaction usually agree upon a certain term or number of periodic
payments. In some calculations, however, this may not hold. In all of the calculations
below, n is assumed integral and in the gnucash implementation, the following calculation
is performed to assure this fact:

<pre>
    n = int(n)
</pre>

<ol>
<li>final_pmt == final payment @ payment n
<p>From the basic financial equation derived above:

<pre>
       PV[n] = PV[n-1]*(1 + i) + final_pmt * (1 + iX), i == effective interest rate
</pre>

<p>solving for final_pmt, we have:
<p>NOTE: FV[n] = -PV[n], for any n

<pre>
       final_pmt * (1 + iX) = PV[n] - PV[n-1]*(1 + i)
                            = FV[n-1]*(1 + i) - FV[n]
       final_pmt = FV[n-1]*(1+i)/(1 + iX) - FV[n]/(1 + iX)

       final_pmt = FV[n-1]*(1 + i) - FV[n], for X == 0, end of period payments
                 = FV[n-1] - FV[n]/(1 + i), for X == 1, beginning of period payments
</pre>

<li>final_pmt == final payment @ payment n

<pre>
       i[n] == interest due @ payment n
       i[n] = (PV[n-1] + X * final_pmt) * i, i == effective interest rate
            = (X * final_pmt - FV[n]) * i
</pre>

<p>Now the final payment is the sum of the interest due, plus the present value
at the next to last payment plus any residual future value after the last payment:

<pre>
       final_pmt = -i[n] - PV[n-1] - FV[n]
                 = FV[n-1] - i[n] - FV[n]
                 = FV[n-1] - (X *final_pmt - FV[n-1])*i - FV[n]
                 = FV[n-1]*(1 + i) - X*final_pmt*i - FV[n]
</pre>

<p>solving for final_pmt:

<pre>
       final_pmt*(1 + iX) = FV[n-1]*(1 + i) - FV[n]
       final_pmt = FV[n-1]*(1 + i)/(1 + iX) - FV[n]/(1 + iX)

       final_pmt = FV[n-1]*(1 + i) - FV[n], for X == 0, end of period payments
                 = FV[n-1] - FV[n]/(1 + i), for X == 1, beginning of period payments
</pre>

<li>In a constant repayment to principal loan, each payment varies. A constant amount
is applied to the principal for each payment, usually equal to the originating present value
divided by the number of repayment periods, and the interest for the payment period is
added to the constant principal payment. The derivation of the equation for this type
is contained in the <A HREF="constderv.html#TOP">Constant Repayment Equations</A> section. This
case computes the amortization schedule with the original loan data and a constant repayment
to principal.

<h3>Constant Repayment to Principal, Delayed Repayment</h3>
<li>In a constant repayment to principal loan, each payment varies. A constant amount
is applied to the principal for each payment, usually equal to the originating present value
divided by the number of repayment periods, and the interest for the payment period is
added to the constant principal payment. The derivation of the equation for this type
is contained in the <A HREF="constderv.html#TOP">Constant Repayment Equations</A> section. This
case computes the amortization schedule with the delayed loan data and a constant repayment
to principal.

<A name="OrigData">
<h3>Original Data Schedule</h3></A>
<li>The original financial data is used. This ignores any possible agjustment to
the Present value due to any delay in the initial payment. This is quite
common in mortgages where end of period payments are used and the first
payment is scheduled for the end of the first whole period, i.e., any
partial payment period from ED to the beginning of the next payment period
is ignored.

<A name="NewFinalPayment">
<h3>Recomputed Final Payment</h3></A>
<li>The original periodic payment is used, the Present Value is adjusted for the
delayed Initial Payment. The total number of payments remains the same. The
final payment is adjusted to bring the balance into agreement with the
agreed upon final Future Value.

<A name="NewPayment">
<h3>Recomputed Periodic Payment</h3></A>
<li>A new periodic payment is computed based upon the adjusted Present Value, the
originally agreed upon number of total payments and the agreed upon Future Value.
The new periodic payments are computed to minimize the final payment in accordance
with the Future Value after the last payment.

<A name="NewTerm">
<h3>Recomputed Term</h3></A>
<li>The original periodic payment is retained and a new number of total payments is computed
based upon the adjusted Present Value and the agreed upon Future Value.

<a name="DisplaySched">
<h2>Amortization Schedule Display</h2></A>
<p>The amortization schedule may be computed and displayed in three manners:

<ol>
<li>The payment#, interest paid, principal paid and remaining PV for each payment period
are computed and displayed.
<p>At the end of each year a summary is computed and displayed
and the total interest paid is displayed at the end.

<li>A summary is computed and displayed for each year. The interest paid during the
year is computed and displayed as well as the remaining balance at years end.
<p>The total interest paid is displayed at the end.

<li>An amortization schedule is computed and displayed for a common method of
advanced payment of principal.
<p>In this amortization schedule, the principal for the
next payment is computed and added into the current payment. This method will
cut the number of total payments in half and will cut the interest paid almost
in half.
<p>For mortgages, this method of prepayment has the advantage of keeping
the total payments small during the initial payment periods
The payments grow until the last payment period when presumably the borrower
can afford larger payments.
</ol>

<!--================================================================================-->
<p>NOTE: For Payment Frequencies, PF, semi-monthly or less, i.e., PF == 12 or PF == 24,
a 360 day calendar year and 30 day month are used. For Payment Frequencies, PF,
greater than semi-monthly, PF > 24, the actual number of days per year and per payment
period are used. The actual values are computed using the built-in 'jdn' function

<a name="CalcInput">
<h2>Calculator Input</h2></a>
<p>The calculator displays an <tt>input prompt</tt> whenever it is waiting for input
from the keyboard. The <tt>input prompt</tt> is simply <tt>&#60;&#62;</tt>. The desired
input is typed at the keyboard and the enter key pressed. The result of calculating the
value of the input line is then displayed by the calculator. For example, if the user wanted
to set the value of the nominal interest in the calculator to 6.25, the following line would be
input to the calculator:

<p><tt>i=6.25</tt>.

<p>A semi-colon at the end of the input is optional.
The line as seen on the display with the calculator input prompt would be:

<pre>
<>i = 6.25
    6.25
</pre>

<p>Note that the calculator displays the value of the result, 6.25 in this case.

<p>The calculator is controlled by setting the calculator variables to the desired values
and <tt>"executing"</tt> the calculator functions to derive the values for the unknown
variables. For example, for a conventional home mortgage for $233,350.00 with a thirty year
term, nominal annual rate of 7.25%, n, i, pv and fv are known:

<pre>
n == 360 == 12 * 30
i == 7.25
pv= 233350
fv = 0
</pre>

<p>The payments to completely pay off the mortgage with the 360 periodic payments is desired.
To compute the desired periodic payment value, the <tt>PMT</tt> function is used. Since the
function has no defined arguments, in invoking the function no arguments are specified. The
complete session to input the desired values and calculate the periodic payment value would
appear as:

<pre>
<>n=30*12
        360
<>i=7.25
        7.25
<>pv=233350
        233,350
<>PMT
        -1,591.86
</pre>

<p>Note that the input may contain computations, <tt>n=30*12</tt>. In addition, any QTAwk
built-in function may be specified and any functions defined in the financial calculator.
This can be handy for computing intermediate values or other results from the results of
the calculator.

<p>Note that the output of the <tt>PMT</tt> function is rounded to the nearest cent. Over the
thirty year term of the payback, the rounding will affect the last payment. To determine
the balance due, fv, after 359 payment have been made, decrement n by 1 and compute the
future value:

<pre>
<>n-=1
        359
<>FV
        -1,580.20
<>n+=1
        360
<>FV
        2.12
<>
</pre>

<p>The future value after 359 payments is less than the periodic payment and a full final payment
will overpay the loan. The final FV computation with n restored to 360 shows an overpayment
of 2.12.

<a name="CalcFun">
<h2>Calculator Functions</h2></a>
<p>The calculator functions:

<pre>
N
I
PV
PMT
FV
</pre>

<p>can be used to calculate the variable with the corresponding lower case name, using the
values of the other four calculator variables which have already been set. In addition, the
calculator functions:

<pre>
_N(i,pv,pmt,fv,CF,PF,disc,bep)
_I(n,pv,pmt,fv,CF,PF,disc,bep)
_PV(n,i,pmt,fv,CF,PF,disc,bep)
_PMT(n,i,pv,fv,CF,PF,disc,bep)
_FV(n,i,pv,pmt,CF,PF,disc,bep)
</pre>

<p>can be used to compute the value of the corresponding quantity for any specified value
of the input arguments.

<p>There are three differences between the functions <tt>N, I, PV, PMT, FV</tt> and the
functions
<tt>_N(i,pv,pmt,fv,CF,PF,disc,bep), _I(n,pv,pmt,fv,CF,PF,disc,bep), _PV(n,i,pmt,fv,CF,PF,disc,bep),
_PMT(n,i,pv,fv,CF,PF,disc,bep), _FV(n,i,pv,pmt,CF,PF,disc,bep)</tt>.
<ol>
<li>The first set of functions take no arguments and
use the calculator variables, n, i, pv, pmt, fv, CF, PF, disc
and bep to compute the desired value. The second set of functions use the values passed in
the function arguments. The first set of functions call the second set with the necessary
arguments.
<li>The first set of functions round the computed value returned by the call to the second set
of functions to the nearest cent. The second set of functions perform no rounding.
<li>The first set of functions set the calculator variables with the corresponding lower case name
to the value computed. The second set of functions set no global variable values.
</ol>

<a name="UserVar">
<h2>User Defined Variables</h2></a>
<p>User defined variables may be defined and their values set to a desired qunatity. For example,
to save computation results before re-initializing the calculator to obtain other results. If
the user desired to compare the periodic payments necessary to fully pay the conventional
mortgage cited above, the payment computed above could be saved in the variable
<tt>end_pmt</tt>, the payments set to beginning of period payments and the new payment
computed. The new value could be set into the variable <tt>beg_pmt</tt>. The two payments
could then be viewed with the <tt>u</tt> command. The difference could then be computed
between the two payment methods:

<pre>
<>n=30*12
        360
<>i=7.25
        7.25
<>pv=233350
        233,350
<>PMT
        -1,591.86
<>end_pmt=pmt
        -1,591.86
<>bep=1
        1
<>PMT
        -1,582.30
<>beg_pmt=pmt

<p>The financial calculator is thus a true calculator and can be used for computations
desired by the user beyond those performed by the functions of the utility.

<a name="Rounding">
<h2>Rounding</h2></a>
<p>Note that the output of the calculator is rounded to the nearest cent for floating
point values. Sometimes the full accuracy of the value is desired. This can be obtained
by redefing the calculator variable <tt>ofmt</tt> to the string "%.15g". You might want to
save the current value in a user variable for resetting. For example in the above
conventional mortgage, the exact value of the periodic payment can be displayed as:

<pre>
<>sofmt=ofmt
        "%.2f"
<>ofmt="%.15g"
        "%.15g"
<>pmt=_PMT(n,i,pv,fv,CF,PF,disc,bep)
        -1,591.85834951112
<>ofmt=sofmt
        "%.2f"
<>
</pre>

<p>Note that the current value of the output format string, <tt>ofmt</tt>, has been
saved in the variable, <tt>sofmt</tt>, and later restored.

<p>The complete amortization table can be viewed in the
<A HREF="./amortp.html#AmortPer">Periodic Amortization Schedule</A> for this loan.

<p>You will notice several differences between this amortization schedule and the
Annual Summary Schedule. The Periodic Payment Schedule lists the interest paid for
each payment as well as the principal paid and the remaining balance to be repaid.
At the end of each year an annual summary is printed. At the end of the table the
total interest is printed as in the Annual Summary Schedule.

<p>You will notice that the total interest output at the end of the Periodic Payment
Schedule differs slightly from the total interest output at the end of the Annual Summary
Schedule:

<p>Total Interest for Periodic Payment Schedule:
<pre>
  Total Interest: -305,379.74
</pre>

<p>Total Interest for Annual Summary Schedule:

<pre>
  Total Interest: -305,378.87
</pre>

<p>The difference in total interest is due to the rounding of all quantities at
each periodic payment. The Total Interest paid shown in the Periodic Payment
Schedule will be the more accurate since all quantities exchanged in a financial
transaction will be done to the nearest cent.

<p>The complete amortization table can be viewed in the
<A HREF="./amorta.html#AmortAdv">Advanced Payment Amortization Schedule</A> for this loan.

<p>This schedule has added two columns over the Periodic Payment Schedule in Example 7. Namely,
<tt>Prepay</tt> and the <tt>Total Pmt</tt> columns. The <tt>Prepay</tt> column is the
amount of the loan prepayment for the period. The <tt>Total Pmt</tt> column is the sum
of the periodic payment and the Prepayment. Note that both the <tt>Prepay</tt> and the
<tt>Total Pmt</tt> quantities increase with each period.

<p>Conventional Mortgage Schedule - Constant Advanced Payments
<p>Using the loan in the previous examples, compute the amortization table using
another payment option for repaying a loan ahead of schedule and reducing the interest
paid, constant repayments at each periodic payment. Suppose a constant $100.00 is paid
towards the principal with each periodic payment. How many payments are needed to fully payoff
the loan and what is the total interest paid?

<p>As in the previous example, ignore any increase in the PV due to the
delayed IP.

<p>There are two ways to compute the amortization table for this type of prepayment option.
In the first method, set the variable 'FP' to the amount of the monthly prepayment.
