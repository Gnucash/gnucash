/** @addtogroup SplitRegister Split Register
 *  @brief GnuCash-specific ledger and journal displays based on
 *  @ref RegisterCore.
 *
 *  @details The split register is a spreadsheet-like area that looks like
 *  a checkbook register. It displays transactions and allows the user to
 *  edit them in-place. The register does @b not contain any of the other
 *  window decorations that one might want to have for a free standing window
 *  (e.g. menubars, *  toolbars, etc.)
 *
 *  The layout of the register is configurable. There's a broad
 *  variety of cell types to choose from: date cells that know
 *  how to parse dates, price cells that know how to parse prices,
 *  etc.  These cells can be laid out in any column; even a multi-row
 *  layout is supported.  The name "split register" is derived from
 *  the fact that this register can display multiple rows of
 *  transaction splits underneath a transaction title/summary row.
 *
 *  An area for entering new transactions is provided at the bottom of
 *  the register.
 *
 *  All user input to the register is handled by the 'cursor', which
 *  is mapped onto one of the displayed rows.
 *
 *  @par Design Notes.
 *  @{
 *  Some notes about the "blank split":@n
 *  Q: What is the "blank split"?@n
 *  A: A new, empty split appended to the bottom of the ledger
 *  window.  The blank split provides an area where the user
 *  can type in new split/transaction info.
 *  The "blank split" is treated in a special way for a number
 *  of reasons:
 *  -  it must always appear as the bottom-most split
 *     in the Ledger window,
 *  -  it must be committed if the user edits it, and
 *     a new blank split must be created.
 *  -  it must be deleted when the ledger window is closed.
 *
 *  To implement the above, the register "user_data" is used
 *  to store an SRInfo structure containing the blank split.
 *  @}
 *
 *  @par Some notes on Commit/Rollback:
 *  @{
 *  There's an engine component and a gui component to the commit/rollback
 *  scheme.  On the engine side, one must always call BeginEdit()
 *  before starting to edit a transaction.  When you think you're done,
 *  you can call CommitEdit() to commit the changes, or RollbackEdit() to
 *  go back to how things were before you started the edit. Think of it as
 *  a one-shot mega-undo for that transaction.
 *
 *  Note that the query engine uses the original values, not the currently
 *  edited values, when performing a sort.  This allows your to e.g. edit
 *  the date without having the transaction hop around in the gui while you
 *  do it.
 *
 *  On the gui side, commits are now performed on a per-transaction basis,
 *  rather than a per-split (per-journal-entry) basis.  This means that
 *  if you have a transaction with a lot of splits in it, you can edit them
 *  all you want without having to commit one before moving to the next.
 *
 * Similarly, the "cancel" button will now undo the changes to all of the
 * lines in the transaction display, not just to one line (one split) at a
 * time.
 * @}
 *
 * @par Some notes on Reloads & Redraws:
 * @{
 * Reloads and redraws tend to be heavyweight. We try to use change flags
 * as much as possible in this code, but imagine the following scenario:
 *
 * Create two bank accounts.  Transfer money from one to the other.
 * Open two registers, showing each account. Change the amount in one window.
 * Note that the other window also redraws, to show the new correct amount.
 *
 * Since you changed an amount value, potentially *all* displayed
 * balances change in *both* register windows (as well as the ledger
 * balance in the main window).  Three or more windows may be involved
 * if you have e.g. windows open for bank, employer, taxes and your
 * entering a paycheck (or correcting a typo in an old paycheck).
 * Changing a date might even cause all entries in all three windows
 * to be re-ordered.
 *
 * The only thing I can think of is a bit stored with every table
 * entry, stating 'this entry has changed since lst time, redraw it'.
 * But that still doesn't avoid the overhead of reloading the table
 * from the engine.
 * @}
 *
 *  The Register itself is independent of GnuCash, and is designed
 *  so that it can be used with other applications.
 *  The Ledger is an adaptation of the Register for use by GnuCash.
 *  The Ledger sets up an explicit visual layout, putting certain
 *  types of cells in specific locations (e.g. date on left, summary
 *  in middle, value at right), and hooks up these cells to
 *  the various GnuCash financial objects.
 *
 *  This code is also theoretically independent of the actual GUI
 *  toolkit/widget-set (it once worked with both Motif and Gnome).
 *  The actual GUI-toolkit specific code is supposed to be in a
 *  GUI portability layer.  Over the years, some gnome-isms may
 *  have snuck in; these should also be cleaned up.
