 *
 * The function starts with the first lot in the list and tries to
 * create balancing transactions to the remainder of the lots in the
 * list. If it reaches the end of the list, it will find the next
 * still open lot in the list and tries to balance it with all lots
 * that follow it (the ones that precede it are either already closed
 * or not suitable or they would have been processed in a previous
 * iteration).
 *
 * By intelligently sorting the list of lots, you can play with the
 * order of precedence in which the lots should be processed. For
 * example, by sorting the oldest invoice lots first, the code will
 * attempt to balance these first.
 *
 * Some restrictions:
 * - the algorithm is lazy: it will create the smallest balancing
 *   transaction(s) possible, not the largest ones. Since the process
 *   is iterative, you will have balanced the maximum amount possible
 *   in the end, but it may be done in several transactions instead of
 *   only one big one.
 * - the balancing transactions only work within one account. If a
 *   balancing lot is from another account than the lot currently being
 *   balanced, it will be skipped during balance evaluation. However
 *   if there is a mix of lots from two different accounts, the algorithm
 *   will still attempt to match all lots per account.
 * - the calling function is responsible for the memory management
 *   of the lots list. If it created the list, it should properly free
 *   it as well.
