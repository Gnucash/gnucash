/*
 * Financial Calculator
 *
 * This version for use WITH ANSI.SYS display driver
 *
 *  This is a complete financial computation utility to solve for the
 *  five * standard financial values: n, %i, PV, PMT and FV
 *
 *    n   == number of payment periods
 *    %i  == nominal interest rate, NAR, charged
 *    PV  == Present Value
 *    PMT == Periodic Payment
 *    FV  == Future Value
 *
 *  In addition, two additional parameters may be specified:
 *
 *    1) Compounding Frequency per year, CF. The compounding frequency
 *    per year may be discrete or continuous and may be different from
 *    the Payment Frequency per year
 *
 *    2) Payment Frequency per year, PF. Payments may be made at the
 *    beginning or the end of the payment period.
 *
 *  When an amortization schedule is desired, the financial
 *  transaction Effective Date, ED, and Initial Payment Date, IP, must
 *  also be entered.
 *
 *  Canadian and European style mortgages can be handled in a simple,
 *  straight-forward manner. Standard financial sign conventions are
 *  used:
 *
 *          "Money paid out is Negative, Money received is Positive"
 *
 *  Time value of money:
 *
 *  If you borrow money, you can expect  to pay rent or interest for its  use;
 * conversely you expect to receive rent interest on money you loan or invest.
 * When you rent property, equipment,  etc., rental payments are normal;  this
 * is  also  true  when  renting  or  borrowing  money.  Therefore,  money  is
 * considered to have a "time value". Money available now, has a greater value
 * than money available at some future date because of its rental value or the
 * interest that it can produce during the intervening period.
 *
 *  Simple Interest:
 *
 *  If you loaned $800 to  a friend with an agreement  that at the end of  one
 * year he would  would repay you  $896, the "time  value" you placed  on your
 * $800 (principal) was $96 (interest) for  the one year period (term) of  the
 * loan. This  relationship of  principal, interest,  and time (term) is  most
 * frequently expressed as an Annual  Percentage Rate (APR). In this  case the
 * APR  was  12.0%  [(96/800)*100].  This  example  illustrates the four basic
 * factors involved  in a  simple interest  case. The  time period (one year),
 * rate (12.0%  APR), present  value of  the principal  ($800) and  the future
 * value of the principal including interest ($896).
 *
 *  Compound Interest:
 *
 *  In many cases the interest charge is computed periodically during the term
 * of  the  agreement.  For  example,  money  left  in a savings account earns
 * interest that  is periodically  added to  the principal  and in  turn earns
 * additional interest during succeeding periods. The accumulation of interest
 * during  the  investment  period  represents  compound interest. If the loan
 * agreement you  made with  your friend  had specified  a "compound  interest
 * rate" of  12% (compounded  monthly) the  $800 principal  would have  earned
 * $101.46 interest for the  one year period. The  value of the original  $800
 * would be increased  by 1% the  first month to  $808 which in  turn would be
 * increased  by  1%  to  816.08 the second month,  reaching a future value of
 * $901.46 after the twelfth iteration. The monthly compounding of the nominal
 * annual rate (NAR) of 12% produces an effective Annual Percentage Rate (APR)
 * of 12.683% [(101.46/800)*100].  Interest may be  compounded at any  regular
 * interval; annually, semiannually, monthly, weekly, daily, even continuously
 * (a specification in some financial models).
 *
 *  Periodic Payments:
 *
 *  When money is loaned for longer  periods of time, it is customary  for the
 * agreement to require the borrower  to make periodic payments to  the lender
 * during the term of the loan. The payments may be only large enough to repay
 * the interest,  with the  principal due  at the  end of  the loan period (an
 * interest only loan), or large enough  to fully repay both the interest  and
 * principal during the term of the loan (a fully amoritized loan). Many loans
 * fall somewhere between, with payments that do not fully cover repayment  of
 * both the principal and interst. These loans require a larger final  payment
 * (balloon)  to  complete  their  amortization.  Payments  may  occur  at the
 * beginning or end of a payment period. If you and your friend had agreed  on
 * monthly repayment of  the $800 loan  at 12% NAR  compounded monthly, twelve
 * payments of $71.08 for a total of $852.96 would be required to amortize the
 * loan. The $101.46  interest from the  annual plan is  more than the  $52.96
 * under the monthly plan because under the monthly plan your friend would not
 * have had the use of $800 for a full year.
 *
 *  Financial Transactions:
 *
 *  The  above  paragraphs  introduce  the  basic  factors  that  govern  most
 * financial  transactions;  the  time  period,  interest rate, present value,
 * payments and  the future  value. In  addition, certain  conventions must be
 * adhered to: the interest rate must be relative to the compounding frequency
 * and payment periods, and the term must be expressed as the total number  of
 * payments (or compounding periods if there are no payments). Loans,  leases,
 * mortgages, annuities, savings plans, appreciation, and compound growth  are
 * among the many financial problems that can be defined in these terms. Some
 * transactions do not involve payments, but  all of the other factors play  a
 * part in "time value of money" transactions. When any one of the five  (four
 * - if no payments are involved)  factors is unknown, it can be  derived from
 * formulas using the known factors.
 *
 * Standard Financial Conventions Are:
 *
 *  Money RECEIVED is a POSITIVE value and is represented by an arrow
 *  above * the line
 *
 *  Money PAID OUT is a NEGATIVE value and is represented by an arrow
 *  below * the line.
 *
 *  If payments are a part of the transaction, the number of payments
 *  must * equal the number of periods (n).

 * ****************************************************************************
 *
 *   First lets discuss interest before discussing the financial
 *   equation. Most financial transactions utilize a nominal interest
 *   rate, NAR, i.e., the interest rate per year. The NAR must be
 *   converted to the interest rate per payment interval and the
 *   compounding accounted for before it can be used in computing an
 *   interest payment. After this conversion process, the interest
 *   used is the effective interest rate, EIR. In converting NAR to
 *   EIR, there are two concepts to discuss first, the Compounding
 *   Frequency and the Payment Frequency and * whether the interest is
 *   coumpounded in discrete intervals or continuously. The
 *   compounding Frequency, CF, is simply the number of times per
 *   year, the monies in the financial transaction are compounded. In
 *   the U.S., monies are usually compounded daily on bank deposits,
 *   and monthly on loans. Somtimes Long term deposits are compounded
 *   quarterly or weekly.
 *
 *   The Payment Frequency, PF, is simply how often during a year
 *   payments are made in the transaction. Payments are usually
 *   scheduled on a regular basis and can be made at the beginning or
 *   end of the payment period. If made at the beginning of the
 *   payment period, interest must be applied to the payment as well
 *   as any previous money paid or money still owed.
 *
 *   Normal values for CF and PF are:
 *   1   == annual
 *   2   == semi-annual
 *   3   == tri-annual
 *   4   == quaterly
 *   6   == bi-monthly
 *   12  == monthly
 *   24  == semi-monthly
 *   26  == bi-weekly
 *   52  == weekly
 *   360 == daily
 *   365 == daily
 *
 *  a) the Compounding Frequency per year, CF, need not be identical
 *  to the Payment Frequency per year, PF, and/or,
 *
 *  b) Interest may be compounded in either discrete intervals or continuously
 *     compounded.
 *
 *  c) Also, payments may be made at the beginning of the payment
 *  period or at the end of the payment period.
 *
 *  CF and PF are defaulted to 1. The default is for discrete interest
 *  intervals and payments are defaulted to the end of the payment
 *  period.
 *
 *  When a solution  for n, PV,  PMT or FV  is required, the  nominal interest
 * rate, i, must first be converted to the effective interest rate per payment
 * period. This rate, ieff, is then used to compute the selected variable.  To
 * convert i to ieff, the following expressions are used:
 *
 *  Discrete interest periods:
 *
 * 19) ieff = (1 + i/CF)^(CF/PF) - 1
 *
 *  Continuous Interest
 *
 * 20) ieff = e^(i/PF) - 1 = exp(i/PF) - 1
 *
 *  When interest is computed, the computation produces the effective interest
 * rate, ieff. This value must then be converted to the nominal interest rate.
 * Function  _I  below  returns  the  nominal  interest rate NOT the effective
 * interest rate. ieff is converted to i using the following expressions:
 *
 *  Discrete Case:
 *
 *     i = CF*[(1+ieff)^(PF/CF) - 1]
 *
 *  Continuous Case:
 *
 *     i = ln[(1+ieff)^PF]
 *
 * ****************************************************************************
 *
 *   NOTE: in the equations below for the financial transaction, all
 *   interest rates are the effective interest rate, ieff. The symbol
 *   will be shortned to just 'i'.
 *
 * ****************************************************************************
 *
 * The basic financial equation used is:
 *
 *  1) PV*(1 + i)^n + PMT*(1 + iX)*[(1+i)^n - 1]/i + FV = 0
 *   Where: X = 0 for end of period payments, and
 *          X = 1 for beginning of period payments
 *
 * ****************************************************************************
 *
 *   NOTE: this equation is derived in the following manner:
 *
 *   Start with the basic equation to find the balance or Present
 *   Value, PV[1], after one payment period. Note PV[1] is the Present
 *   value after on payment and PV[0] is the initial Present
 *   Value. PV[0] will be shortened to just PV.
 *
 *   The interest due at the end of the first payment period is:
 *
 *   ID[1] = (PV + X * PMT) * i
 *       where: X = 0 for end of period payments, and
 *              X = 1 for beginning of period payments.
 *
 *   Thus:
 *   PV[1] = PV + (PMT + ID[1])
 *         = PV + (PMT + (PV + X * PMT) * i)
 *         = PV * (1 + i) + PMT * (1 + Xi)
 *
 *   This equation works for all of the money diagrams shown
 *   above. The Present Value, money received or paid, is modified by
 *   a payment made at the beginning of a payment period and
 *   multiplied by the effective interest rate to compute the interest
 *   due during the payment period. The interest due is then added to
 *   the payment to obtain the amount to be added to the Present Value
 *   to compute the new Present Value.
 *
 *   For diagram 1): PV <  0, PMT == 0, PV[1] < 0
 *   For diagram 2): PV == 0, PMT <  0, PV[1] < 0
 *   For Diagram 3): PV >  0, PMT <  0, PV[1] >= 0 or PV[1] <= 0
 *   For Diagram 4): PV <  0, PMT >  0, PV[1] <= 0 or PV[1] >= 0
 *
 *   X may be 0 or 1 for any diagram.
 *
 *   For the standard loan, PV is the money borrowed, PMT is the
 *   periodic payment to repay the loan and i is the effective
 *   interest rate agreed upon.
 *
 *   To calculate the Present Value after the second payment period,
 *   the above calculation is applied iteratively to PV_1:
 *
 *   PV[2] = PV[1] + (PMT + (PV[1] + X * PMT) * i)
 *         = PV[1] * (1 + i) + PMT * (1 + iX)
 *         = (PV * (1 + i) + PMT * (1 + iX)) * (1 + i) + PMT * (1 + iX)
 *         = PV * (1 + i)^2 + PMT * (1 + iX) * (1 + i)
 *                          + PMT * (1 + iX)
 *
 *   Similarly:
 *
 *   PV[3] = PV[2] + (PMT + (PV[2] + X * PMT) * i)
 *         = PV[2] * (1 + i) + PMT * (1 + iX)
 *         = PV * (1 + i)^2 + PMT * (1 + iX) * (1 + i)
 *                          + PMT * (1+  iX)) * ( 1 + i)
 *                          + PMT * (1+  iX)
 *         = PV * (1 + i)^3 + PMT * (1 + iX) * (1 + i)^2
 *                          + PMT * (1 + iX) * (1 + i)^2
 *                          + PMT * (1 + iX) * (1 + i)
 *                          + PMT * (1 + iX)
 *
 *   And for the n'th payment:
 *
 *   PV[n] = PV[n-1] + (PMT + (PV[n-1] + X * PMT) * i)
 *   PV[n] = PV * (1 + i)^n + PMT * (1 + iX) * (1 + i)^(n-1)
 *                          + PMT * (1 + iX) * (1 + i)^(n-2) +
 *                          .
 *                          .
 *                          .
 *                          + PMT * (1 + iX) * (1 + i)
 *                          + PMT * (1 + iX)
 *   PV[n] = PV * (1 + i)^n + PMT * (1 + iX) * [(1 + i)^(n-1) + ...
 *           + (1 + i) + 1]

 *
 *       The sum of the finite series:
 *
 *       1 + k + (k^2) + (k^3) + ... + (k^n) = (1-k^(n+1))/(1-k)
 *
 *       as can be seen by the following. Let S(n) be the series sum. Then
 *
 *       S(n) - k * S(n) = 1 - k^(n+1)
 *
 *       and solving for S(n):
 *
 *       S(n) = [1-k^(n+1)]/[1-k] = 1 + k + (k^2) + (k^3) + ... + (k^n)
 *
 * ****************************************************************************
 *
 *   PV[n] = PV * (1 + i)^n + PMT * (1 + iX) * [(1 + i)^(n-1) + ...
 *           + (1 + i) + 1]
 *         = PV * (1 + i)^n + PMT * (1 + iX) * [1 - (1 + i)^n]/[1 - (1 + i)]
 *         = PV * (1 + i)^n + PMT * (1 + iX) * [1 - (1 + i)^n]/[-i]
 *         = PV * (1 + i)^n + PMT * (1 + iX) * [(1 + i)^n - 1]/i
 *
 *   The formaula for PV[n] can be proven using mathematical induction.
 *
 *   or:
 *
 *   PV * (1 + i)^n + PMT * [(1 + i)^n - 1]/i - PV[n] = 0
 *
 *   If after n payments, the remaining balance is repaid as a lump
 *   sum, the lump sum is known as the Future Value, FV[n]. Since
 *   FV[n] is negative if paid and positive if received, FV[n] is the
 *   negative of PV[n]. Since n is assumed to be the last payment,
 *   FV[n] will be shortened to simply FV.
 *
 *   Setting: FV = -PV[N]
 *
 *   1)  PV*(1 + i)^n + PMT*(1 + iX)*[(1 + i)^n - 1]/i + FV = 0
 *
 *   Up to this point, we have said nothing about the value of
 *   PMT. PMT can be any value mutually agreed upon by the lender and
 *   the borrower. From the equation for PV[1]:
 *
 *   PV[1] = PV + (PMT + (PV + X * PMT) * i),
 *
 *   Several things can be said about PMT.
 *
 *   1. If PMT = PV * i, and X = 0 (end of period payments):
 *
 *      The payment is exactly equal to the interest due and PV[1] =
 *      PV. In this case, the borrower must make larger future
 *      payments to reduce the balance due, or make a single payment,
 *      after some agreed upon number of payments, with PMT = PV to
 *      completely pay off the loan. This is an interest only payment
 *      with a balloon payment at the end.
 *
 *   2. If PMT < PV * i, and X = 0
 *
 *      The payment is insufficient to cover even the interest charged
 *      and the balance due grows
 *
 *   3. If PMT > PV * i, and X = 0
 *
 *      The payment is sufficient to cover the interest charged with a
 *      residual amount to be applied to reduce the balance due. The
 *      larger the residual amount, the faster the loan is repaid. For
 *      most mortgages or other loans made today, the lender and
 *      borrower agree upon a certain number of repayment periods and
 *      the interest to be charged per payment period.  The interest
 *      may be multiplied by 12 and stated as an annual interest
 *      rate. Then the lender and borrower want to compute a periodic
 *      payment, PMT, which will reduce the balance due to zero after
 *      the agreed upon number of payment have been made. If N is the
 *      agreed upon number of periodic payments, then we want to use:
 *
 *      PV * (1 + i)^N + PMT*(1 +iX)*[(1 + i)^N - 1]/i + FV = 0
 *
 *      with FV = 0 to compute PMT:
 *
 *      PMT = -[PV * i * (1 + i)^(N - X)]/[(1 + i)^N - 1]
 *
 *      The value of PMT computed will reduce the balance due to zero
 *      after N periodic payments.
 *
 * ****************************************************************************
 *
 *
 * With a simple alegebraic re-arrangement, The financial Equation becomes:
 *
 *  2) [PV + PMT*(1 + iX)/i][(1 + i)^n - 1] + PV + FV = 0
 *
 * or
 *
 *  3) (PV + C)*A + PV + FV = 0
 *
 * where:
 *  4) A = (1 + i)^n - 1
 *
 *  5) B = (1 + iX)/i
 *
 *  6) C = PMT*B
 *
 * The form of equation 3) simplifies the calculation procedure for all five
 * variables, which are readily solved as follows:
 *
 *  7) n = ln[(C - FV)/(C + PV)]/ln((1 + i)
 *
 *  8) PV = -[FV + A*C]/(A + 1)
 *
 *  9) PMT = -[FV + PV*(A + 1)]/[A*B]
 *
 * 10) FV = -[PV + A*(PV + C)]
 *
 * Equations 4), 5) and 6) are computed by functions:
 *
 *  _A
 *  _B
 *  _C
 *
 * respectively. Equations 7), 8), 9) and 10) are computed by functions:
 *
 *  _N
 *  _PV
 *  _PMT
 *  _FV
 *
 * respectively.
 *
 * The solution for interest is broken into two cases:
 *
 *  PMT == 0
 *       i = [FV/PV]^(1/n) - 1
 *
 *  PMT != 0
 *
 *       Since equation 3) cannot be solved explicitly for i in this
 *       case, an iterative technique must be employed. Newton's
 *       method, using exact expressions for the function of i and its
 *       derivative, are employed. The expressions are:
 *

 * ****************************************************************************
 * Constant payment to principal loan
 *
 *   In this loan, each total payment is different, with each
 *   succeeding payment less than the preceding payment. Each payment
 *   is the total of the constant amount to the principal plus the
 *   interest for the period. The constant payment to the principal is
 *   computed as:
 *
 *           C = -PV / N
 *
 *   Where PV is the loan amount to be repaid in N payments
 *   (periods). Note that the constant payment to principal could be
 *   any value agreed to by the two parties involved.
 *
 *   Thus the principal after the first payment is:
 *       PV[1] = PV[0] + C = PV + C
 *   after the second payment, the principal is:
 *       PV[2] = PV[1] + C = PV[0] + 2C
 *   In general, the remaining principal after n payments is:
 *       PV[n] = PV[0] + nC = PV + nC
 *
 *   If the effective interest per payment period is i, then the
 *   interest for the first payment is:
 *
 *       I[1] = -i*PV[0] = -i*PV
 *   and for the second:
 *       I[2] = -i * PV[1]
 *   and in general, for the n'th payment the interest is:
 *       I[n] = -i * PV[n-1]
 *            = -i * (PV + (n-1)C)
 *   The total payment for any period, n, is:
 *       P[n] = C + I[n]
 *            = C + i * (PV + (n-1)C)
 *            = C(1 + i) - i * (PV + nC)
 *   The total interest paid to period n is:
 *       T[n] = I[1] + I[2] + I[3] + ... + I[n]
 *       T[n] = sum(j = 1 to n: I[j])
 *       T[n] = sum(j = 1 to n: -i * (PV + (j-1)C))
 *       T[n] = sum(j=1 to n: -i*PV) + sum(j=1 to n: iC) + sum(j=1 to n: -iCj)
 *       T[n] = -i*n*PV + i*n*C - i*C*sum(j=1 to n:j)
 *           sum(j=1 to n:j) = n(n+1)/2
 *       T[n] = -i*n*(PV + C) - i*C*n(n+1)/2
 *       T[n] = -i*n*(PV + (C*(n - 1)/2))
 *
 * Note: substituing for C = -PV/N, in the equations for PV[n], I[n],
 *   P[n], and T[n] would give the following equations:
 *
 *       PV[n] = PV*(1 - n/N)
 *       I[n]  = -i*PV*(1 + N - n)/N
 *       P[n]  = -i*PV*(2 + N - n)/N
 *       T[n]  = -i*n*PV*(2*N - n + 1)/(2*N)
 *
 *   Using these equations for the calculations would eliminate the
 *   dependence on C, but only if C is always defined as above and
 *   would eliminate the possibility of another value for C. If the
 *   value of C was less than -PV/N then a balloon payment would be
 *   due at the final payment and this is a possible alternative for
 *   some people.

 *
 *   Amortization Schedules.
 *
 *   Financial Transactions have an effective Date, ED, and an Initial Payment
 *   Date, IP. ED may or may not be the same as IP, but IP is always the same
 *   or later than ED. Most financial transaction calculators assume that
 *   IP is equal to ED for beginning of period payments or at the end of the
 *   first payment period for end of period payments.
 *
 *   This is not always true. IP may be delayed for financial reasons
 *   such as cash flow or accounting calendar. The subsequent payments
 *   then follow the agreed upon periodicity. Since money has a time
 *   value, the "delayed" IP must be accounted for. Computing an
 *   "Effective PV", pve, is one means of handling a delayed IP.
 *
 *   EDj == the Julian Day Number of ED, and
 *   IPj == the Julian Day Number of IP in the following.
 *
 *   pve is be computed as:
 *
 *   pve = pv*(1 + i)^(s*PF/d*CF)
 *
 *   Where: d = length of the payment period in days, and
 *          s = IPj - EDj - d*X
 *
 *   Computing an amortization Schedule for a given financial transaction is
 *   simply applying the basic equation iteratively for each payment period:
 *
 *   PV[n] = PV[n-1] + (PMT + (PV[n-1] + X * PMT) * i)
 *
 *   At the end of each iteration, PV[n] is rounded to the nearest cent. For
 *   each payment period, the interest due may be computed separately as:
 *
 *   ID[n] = (PMT + (PV[n-1] + X * PMT) * i)
 *
 *   and rounded to the nearest cent. PV[n] then becomes:
 *
 *   PV[n] = PV[n-1] + PMT + ID[n]
 *
 *   For those cases where a yearly summary only is desired, it is not
 *   necessary to compute each transaction for each payment period,
 *   rather the PV may be be computed for the beginning of each year,
 *   PV[yr], and the FV computed for the end of the year, FV[yr]. The
 *   interest paid during the year is the computed as:
 *
 *   ID[yr] = (NP * PMT) + PV[yr] + FV[yr]
 *
 *   Since the final payment may not be equal to the periodic payment,
 *   the final payment must be computed separately as follows. Two
 *   derivations are given below for the final payment equation. Both
 *   derivations are given below since one or the other may be clearer
 *   to some readers. Both derivations are essentially the same, they
 *   just have different starting points. The first is the fastest.
 *
 *   1) final_pmt == final payment @ payment n == int(n)
 *       from above the basic financial equation:
 *       PV[n] = PV[n-1]*(1 + i) + final_pmt * (1 + iX),
 *       i == effective interest rate
 *
 *       solving for final_pmt, we have:
 *
 *       final_pmt * (1 + iX) = PV[n] - PV[n-1]*(1 + i)
 *                            = FV[n-1]*(1 + i) - FV[n]
 *       final_pmt = FV[n-1]*(1+i)/(1 + iX) - FV[n]/(1 + iX)
 *
 *       final_pmt = FV[n-1]*(1 + i) - FV[n],
 *                   for X == 0, end of period payments
 *
 *                 = FV[n-1] - FV[n]/(1 + i),
 *                   for X == 1, beginning of period payments
 *
 *   2) final_pmt == final payment @ payment n == int(n)
 *       i[n] == interest due @ payment n
 *       i[n] = (PV[n-1] + X * final_pmt) * i, i == effective interest rate
 *            = (X * final_pmt - FV[n]) * i
 *
 *       Now the final payment is the sum of the interest due, plus
 *       the present value at the next to last payment plus any
 *       residual future value after the last payment:
 *
 *       final_pmt = -i[n] - PV[n-1] - FV[n]
 *                 = FV[n-1] - i[n] - FV[n]
 *                 = FV[n-1] - (X *final_pmt - FV[n-1])*i - FV[n]
 *                 = FV[n-1]*(1 + i) - X*final_pmt*i - FV[n]
 *
 *       solving for final_pmt:
 *       final_pmt*(1 + iX) = FV[n-1]*(1 + i) - FV[n]
 *       final_pmt = FV[n-1]*(1 + i)/(1 + iX) - FV[n]/(1 + iX)
 *
 *       final_pmt = FV[n-1]*(1 + i) - FV[n],
 *                   for X == 0, end of period payments
 *
 *                 = FV[n-1] - FV[n]/(1 + i),
 *                   for X == 1, beginning of period payments
 *
 *============================================================================
 *
 *   The amortization schedule is computed for four different situations:
 *
 *   1) The original financial data is used. This ignores any possible
 *   agjustment to the Present value due to any delay in the initial
 *   payment. This is quite common in mortgages where end of period
 *   payments are used and the first payment is scheduled for the end
 *   of the first whole period, i.e., any partial payment period from
 *   ED to the beginning of the next payment period is ignored.
 *
 *   2) The original periodic payment is used, the Present Value is
 *   adjusted for the delayed Initial Payment. The total number of
 *   payments remains the same. The final payment is adjusted to bring
 *   the balance into agreement with the agreed upon final Future
 *   Value.
 *
 *   3) A new periodic payment is computed based upon the adjusted
 *   Present Value, the agreed originally upon number of total
 *   payments and the agreed upon Future Value.  The new periodic
 *   payments are computed to minimize the final payment in accordance
 *   with the Future Value after the last payment.
 *
 *   4) The original periodic payment is retained and a new number of
 *   total payments is computed based upon the adjusted Present Value
 *   and the agreed upon Future Value.
 *
 *   The amortization schedule may be computed and displayed in three manners:
 *
 *   1. The payment *, interest paid, principal paid and remaining PV
 *   for each payment period are computed and displayed. At the end of
 *   each year a summary is computed and displayed and the total
 *   interest paid is diplayed at the end.
 *
 *   2. A summary is computed and displayed for each year. The
 *   interest paid during the year is computed and displayed as well
 *   as the remaining balance at years end.  The total interest paid
 *   is diplayed at the end.
 *
 *   3. An amortization schedule is computed for a common method of
 *   advanced payment of principal is computed and displayed. In this
 *   amortization, the principal for the next payment is computed and
 *   added into the current payment. This method will cut the number
 *   of total payments in half and will cut the interest paid almost
 *   in half. For mortgages, this method of prepayment has the
 *   advantage of keeping the total payments small during the initial
 *   payment periods The payments grow until the last payment period
 *   when presumably the borrower can afford larger payments.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 *   NOTE: For Payment Frequencies, PF, semi-monthly or less, i.e., PF
 *   == 12 or PF == 24, a 360 day calendar year and 30 day month are
 *   used. For Payment Frequencies, PF, greater than semi-monthly, PF
 *   > 24, the actual number of days per year and per payment period
 *   are used. The actual values are computed using the built-in
 *   'julian_day_number' function

 * Example 14: Perpetuity - Continuous Compounding
 * If you can purchase a single payment annuity with an initial investment of
 * $60,000 that will be invested at 15% nominal annual rate compounded
 * continuously, what is the maximum monthly return you can receive without
 * reducing the $60,000 principal? If the principal is not disturbed, the
