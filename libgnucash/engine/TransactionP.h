 * outside of the engine should *never* access any of the structure
 * members directly.
 *
 * Note that this header file also defines prototypes for various
 * routines that perform sub-atomic updates of the accounting
 * structures.  If these routines are not used properly, they
 * can result in inconsistent, unbalanced accounting structures.
 * In other words, their use is dangerous, and their use outside
 * of the scope of the engine is forbidden.

 * the destination, or debiting splits.  The grand total of all
