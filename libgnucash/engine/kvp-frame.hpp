/** @addtogroup KVP

 * A KvpFrame is a set of associations between character strings
 * (keys) and KvpValues.  A KvpValue is notionally a union with
 * possible types enumerated in the KvpValue::Type enum, and includes,
 * among other things, ints, doubles, strings, guids, lists, time
 * and numeric values.  KvpValues may also be other frames, so
 * KVP is inherently hierarchical.
 *
 * Values are stored in a 'slot' associated with a key.
 * Pointers passed as arguments into set_slot and get_slot are the
 * responsibility of the caller.  Pointers returned by get_slot are
 * owned by the kvp_frame.  Make copies as needed.
 *
 * A 'path' is a sequence of keys that can be followed to a value.  Paths are
 * passed as either '/'-delimited strings or as std::vectors of keys. Unlike
 * file system paths, the tokens '.' and '..' have no special meaning.
 *
 * KVP is an implementation detail whose direct use should be avoided; create an
 * abstraction object in libqof to keep KVP encapsulated here and ensure that
 * KVP modifications are written to the database. Two generic abstractions are
 * provided:
 *
 * * @ref qof_instance_set_kvp and @ref qof_instance_get_kvp provide single-item
     access via GValues to support object properties.

 * * @ref qof_book_set_option and @ref qof_book_get_option provide similar
     access for book options.

 *
 * @ref kvpvalues provides a catolog of KVP entries including what objects
 * they're part of and how they're used.
 *
 * ## Purpose
 * KVP is used to extend the class structure without directly reflecting the
 * extension in the database or xML schema. The backend will directly load and
 * store KVP slots without any checking, which allows older versions of GnuCash
 * to load the database without complaint and without damaging the KVP data that
 * they don't understand.
 *
 * When a feature is entirely implemented in KVP and doesn't affect the meaning
 * of the books or other features, this isn't a problem, but when it's not true
 * then it should be registered in @ref UtilFeature so that older versions of
 * GnuCash will refuse to load the database.
 *
 * ## Policy
 * * Document every KVP slot in src/engine/kvp_doc.txt so that it is presented
 * in @ref kvpvalues.
 * * Register a feature in @ref UtilFeature if the use of the KVP in any way
    affects the books or business computations.
 * * Key strings should be all lower case with '-', not spaces, separating words
    and '/' separating frames. Prefer longer and more descriptive names to
    abbreviations, and define a global const char[] to the key or path string so
    that the compiler will catch any typos.
 * * Make good use of the hierarchical nature of KVP by using frames to group
    related slots.
 * * Don't use the KVP API directly outside of libqof, and prefer to use the
     QofInstance and QofBook functions whenever feasible. If those functions
     aren't feasible write a class in libqof to abstract the use of KVP.
 * * Avoid re-using key names in different contexts (e.g. Transactions and
    Splits) unless the slot is used for the same purpose in both.
