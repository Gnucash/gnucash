/** The xaccResolveFilePath() routine is a utility that will accept

 *    qualified path in the file system, i.e. a path that begins with
 *    a leading slash.  First, the current working directory is
 *    searched for the file.  Next, the directory $HOME/.gnucash/data,
 *    and finally, a list of other (configurable) paths.  If the file
 *    is not found, then the path $HOME/.gnucash/data is used.  If
 *    $HOME is not defined, then the current working directory is
 *    used.
