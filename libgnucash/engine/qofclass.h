/** @addtogroup Class
  This file defines a class messaging system reminiscent of
  traditional OO-style setter and getter interfaces to object
  properties.  A C-language object can declare a collection
  of setters and getters on itself that can then be used
  to perform run-time (as opposed to compile-time) bindings
  to the object.

  To put it differently, a QOF class is a set of parameter
  getters and setters that are associated with an object type.
  Given a pointer to some thing, the setters and getters can
  be used to get and set values out of that thing.  Note
  that the pointer to "some thing" need not be a pointer
  to a QOF Entity or Instance (although QOF classes are
  more interesting when used with Entities/Instances).
  What "some thing" is defined entirely by the programmer
  declaring a new QOF Class.

  Because a QOF Class associates getters and setters with
  a type, one can then ask, at run time, what parameters
  are associated with a given type, even if those parameters
  were not known at compile time.  Thus, a QOF Class is
  sort-of like a DynAny implementation.  QOF classes can
  be used to provide "object introspection", i.e. asking
  object to describe itself.

  The QOF Query subsystem depends on QOF classes having been
  declared; the Query uses the getters to get values associated
  with particular instances.

  A QofAccessFunc or QofSetterFunc do not need to be public
  functions, if you need to add functions to an object with an
  established API, define the additional QOF routines as static.
  Only the register routine needs to be public.

are used for one-to-many references between entities and are
implemented using ::QofCollection.
These are \b NOT the same as the main collections in the QofBook.

-# Each ::QofCollection contains one or many entities - *all* of a single type.
-# The entity type within the collection can be determined at run time.
-# Easy conversions to GList or whatever in the param_setfcn handler.
-# Each parameter can have its own collection.
-# Each entity can have a different *type* of collection to its siblings,
provided that it is acceptable to the set function.
-# Each object decides which types are acceptable for which parameter in the
    set functions. This is then part of the API for that object.

        QOF_TYPE_COLLECT has two functions, both related to one-to-many
links:
        - Represent a reference between 2 entities with a list of acceptable types.
        (one object linked to many types of single entities)
            - Represent a reference between one entity and many entities of another type.
            (one object linked to many entities of a single type.)

            If the set function can handle it, it could also be used for true one-to-many
links: one object linked to many entities of many types.

            n.b. Always subject to each collection holding only one type at runtime.
            (otherwise use books).
