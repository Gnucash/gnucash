    <h1>Printing</h1>

    <p> At present, GnuCash does not support any sort of printer
    output. However, you may create a printout of the register
    window contents by opening a register window and selecting <tt>
    Print... To File</tt> from the "File" menu.</p>

    <h1> GnuCash as Web Server</h1>

    <p> Following the latest fashionable trends of <b> Internet
    Hype,</b> GnuCash can also act as a cheesy web server! From an
    open register window, select <tt>Print ... To WWW</tt> from the
    <tt> File</tt> menu. Then aim your browser at <tt>
    http://localhost:1080/</tt> or <tt>
    http://yourmachinename.com:1080/</tt>and you will see your
    register window.</p>

    <p>But, remember, we said <em> cheesy;</em> in order to view
    the page a second time, you have to <em> pick the menu item
    again</em> to "reload" things and allow prepare it for another
    data dump.</p>
