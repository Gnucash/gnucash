Below, a few meta-notes about how prices and the GUI (should) interact:

\section pricecompute Computing Prices

When a price is computed from the (value/amt) that a user entered
in a register, and this price is stored in the priceDB, then 
both the register entry and the price must have links to each other
(via the KVP trees) so that each can be found from the other.

This is needed because if the user enters an incorrect amt or value
or date in the transaction register, and then corrects it later, 
piossibly weeks or months later, the corresponding price in the 
priceDB must be fixed as well.

Similarly, if a user deletes a transaction (possibly because it 
contains an error in date/amt/value), then it is adviasable that
the correpsonding priceDB entry must be deleted as well (since
it is not safe to assume that the price is 'correct').

\section Rounding errors

When doing price math in the register, one must be careful, because
round-off errors can make 'obvious' math inaccurate.  Note that if
we define price as (value/amt), then we will find that 
value != price * amt due to roundoff handling.  One must be careful
and consistent in handling this in the register, as otherwise
users will be driven crazy by inconsitent behaviour.
