/** \page kvpvalues KVP Values used By GnuCash

                    Date Last Revised: August 2003

API: \ref KVP

This file documents the use of keys in the key-value pair system
used by the GnuCash Application (both the engine, and non-engine, GUI
pieces).  Before assigning keys for use, please read the Key-Value 
Policy in the GnuCash Design Document located under src/doc/design.

The format of the data below is:

Name: The name of the key, including key names of parent frames
      with the parent frames listed first, as in a fully-qualified
      filename. Use the '/' character to separate keys.

Type: The type of value stored in the key. The types are listed in
      'kvp_frame.h'.

Entities: Which engine entities (Accounts, Transactions, Splits)
          can use this key. Use 'All' if every entity could have
          the key.

Use: The use to which the key will be put. Include any requirements
     for using the key here. Also include any API calls which use
     the key. If more than one entity can use the key, 

Example:

\verbatim
Name: /my-favorite-thing
Type: string
Entities: Account
Use:  xaccGetMyFavoriteThing(), xaccSetMyFavoriteThing()
      This key stores a text description of the user's
      favorite thing. Do not use this key to store things
      which the user merely likes!
\endverbatim

Please put the keys in alphabetical order.
