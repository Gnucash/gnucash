# environment
#
# This configuration file defines a number of environment variables to set/alter
# during GnuCash startup.
#
# The contents of this file is overwritten with each gnucash update.
# If you want to add your own variables to the environment or wish
# to override what gets set in this file please create a new file
# named "environment.local" next to this one with the same structure:
#
# [Variables]
# VAR_X=value_x
# ....
#
#
# Both files use a very simple syntax:
# <variable_name>=<variable_value>
#
# You can refer to existing environment variables in the new value by
# enclosing it in {}, for example
# NEW_VARIABLE={OLD_VARIABLE}_something
#
# When adding variables that hold a collection of directories (path variables),
# always use ';' to separate the directories. GnuCash will replace these with
# the proper separator for your operating system. For example:
# PATH=/some/extra/path;{PATH}
#
# Finally, GnuCash exports a number of environment variables itself you can use
# here as you see fit. They are read only. GnuCash will ignore any changes you
# make to them. These variables are:
# GNC_HOME the directory where GnuCash was installed. This is the base
#          directory of all the other directories below
# GNC_BIN  the directory where the GnuCash executable resides. This is
#          equivalent to {GNC_HOME}/bin
# GNC_LIB  the directory where the GnuCash private libraries reside. This is
#          equivalent to {GNC_HOME}/lib/gnucash
# GNC_DATA the directory where GnuCash specific additional data is stored,
#          equivalent to {GNC_HOME}/share/gnucash
# GNC_CONF the directory where GnuCash configuration files are stored,
#          equivalent to {GNC_HOME}/etc/gnucash
# SYS_LIB  the directory where the GnuCash public libraries reside. This is
#          equivalent to {GNC_HOME}/lib

[Variables]
# PATH is used to find the finance::quote utility functions
PATH={GNC_BIN};{PATH}

# Tell GnuCash where to look for GnuCash modules
GNC_MODULE_PATH={GNC_LIB};{GNC_MODULE_PATH}

# Tell Guile where to find GnuCash specific guile modules GUILE_LIBS
# can be used to override the path to Guile's own modules; likewise,
# GUILE_COMPILED_LIBS overrides the path to Guile's precompiled
# modules.
# GUILE_LIBS=
# GUILE_COMPILED_LIBS=
GUILE_LOAD_PATH=@GNC_GUILE_LOAD_PATH@;{GUILE_LIBS};{GUILE_LOAD_PATH}

# On Windows {GNC_LIB} points to {GNC_HOME}/bin because that's where the DLLs
# are. It's not where the compiled scheme files are so we use {SYS_LIB} here.
GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH=@GNC_GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH@;{GUILE_COMPILED_LIBS};{GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH}

# Tell Guile where to find GnuCash specific shared libraries
GNC_LIBRARY_PATH={SYS_LIB};{GNC_LIB}
LD_LIBRARY_PATH={GNC_LIBRARY_PATH};{LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
# The same, but for GnuCash on OS X
DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH={GNC_LIBRARY_PATH};{DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH}

# For changing the language GnuCash uses, first refer to
# to https://wiki.gnucash.org/wiki/Locale_Settings.
# If you wish GnuCash to use a different language
# than your OS default language, you can
# 1. copy the two parameters below to the [Variables] section in environment.local,
# 2. remove '# ' in front
# 3. replace nl_BE with your preferred locale
# LANG=nl_BE
# LANGUAGE={LANG}

# Set the location of the gnucash user specific application data
# The default depends on the operating system
# Linux - follows the freedesktop xdg data home specification
# Windows - uses the user's AppData(Roaming)\GnuCash
# OS X/Quarz - uses the value of NSApplicationSupportDirectory/GnuCash
# If these are not what you want, you can override it in enviromnent.local
# GNC_DATA_HOME=

# Similarly you can override the default location for AqBanking's settings.
# This will only be used if gnucash is built with AqBanking support enabled.
# Default: $HOME/.aqbanking
# AQBANKING_HOME=
