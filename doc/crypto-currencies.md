# Support the crypto-currencies (virtual currencies)

Hello everyone.
I'm [@Takym](https://github.com/Takym).

I would like GnuCash to support crypto-currencies and virtual currencies.

## What are crypto-currencies and virtual currencies?
* Crypto-currencies are a new type of "asset" based on the peer-to-peer network. There is no physical.
* Most crypto-currencies use the block chain technology.
* Virtual currencies such as Bitcoin aim to be a currency.
* Please see <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency>, <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_currency>, <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain>, and also <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin> for more information.

## Motivation
* Currently, I cannot create a bank account for crypto-currencies.
* Using of crypto-currencies is now expanding.

## Translation
English           |Japanese
:-----------------|:-------
crypto-currencies |暗号資産
virtual-currencies|仮想通貨
